				<li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Testing Goals</strong> &ndash; We aimed to discover whether users could easily navigate the site’s pages, understand the brand’s hard rock identity, and complete booking or information-related tasks without confusion.</li>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Our Testing Methods</strong>
				</li>
              <ul>
				  <li class="text-white questrial-regular"> The test&rsquo;s participants &ndash; we will use the same participants (8 people) as in our first round of interviews, to make sure we continue with a linear evaluation.</li>
				  <li class="text-white">The test's setting &ndash; it will be done at each person's home, with the laptop open for use. Each session lasts 10–15 minutes, with questions done afterwards and if they want to, thoughts can be spoken during the testing.</li>
				  <li class="text-white">The test's protocol &ndash; Introduction: Provide a quick overview and the tasks to complete (without pre-interviews). Task Execution: Participants perform tasks while their screen interactions are observed and recorded. Feedback Collection: Immediately after each session, we ask the participants a series of questions that determine their experience.</li>

          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights about audience growth patterns. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. This helps us set more realistic benchmarks for the future. Moving forward, we'll leverage this understanding to create more impactful content and engagement approaches that acknowledge the evolving nature of audience building.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 text-white">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white">Based on what we have learned through this already, we will recalculate our objectives.
		  Looking at the initial campaign data, we can observe several key insights: </p>
		  <p class="text-white">
					<ol>
			    <li class="text-white">Instagram significantly outperformed Facebook across all metrics (reach, views, engagement)</li>
				<li class="text-white">Interactive content had moderate engagement but could be optimized</li>
				<li class="text-white">Facebook reach remained consistently low throughout the campaign</li>
			    <li class="text-white">Our reels are too long, which does not keep the attention of our audience</li>
		  			</ol>
			</p>
          <p class="text-white">Future Recommendations:
		  			<ol class="text-white">
			  <li>Platform Strategy Refinement: Primary Focus on Instagram, Given the significantly higher engagement rates, allocate 70% of resources to Instagram and 30% to Facebook.</li>
			  <li>Content Optimization: Video-First Approach, Increase video content from 25% to 50% of all posts, emphasizing authentic behind-the-scenes footage. User-Generated Content Initiative, use more creative hashtags because we use the same hastags in every post. We could partner with featured bands to co-create content before and after performances.</li>
			  <li>Measurement and Analytics: Refined KPIs: Set more realistic growth targets based on logarithmic growth patterns. A/B Testing Schedule: Systematically test different posting times to optimize engagement. Conversion Tracking: Implement mechanisms to track social media influence on actual bar attendance</li>
			  <li>Visual Identity Consistency: Our current posts lack a cohesive visual language, when you look at the feed. We should develop a clear set of visual guidelines including consistent color filters, typography treatments, and branded elements that make our content immediately recognizable even without seeing our logo.</li>
		  			</ol>
		  </p>
			
          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. We've also learned that our reels are too long, which fails to maintain audience attention, and that interactive content has potential but needs optimization to fully engage our target audience. Facebook's consistently low reach across all content types indicates we should recalibrate our platform strategy to prioritize where our audience is most responsive.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <p class="text-white">Our research and interviews indicate that the hard rock genre has significantly declined in mainstream prominence compared to previous decades. This diminished visibility negatively affects both fans and aspiring musicians. Specifically, emerging hard rock bands face difficulties in securing venues to showcase their talent, as venues are hesitant to book lesser-known or new artists. Consequently, the pipeline for new talent within the genre has stagnated, hindering the overall growth and vitality of hard rock music. Existing hard rock concerts, festivals, and events have become increasingly expensive, limiting accessibility for dedicated fans and further isolating the community from engaging fully with the music they love.</p>
		  
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">An intimate, genre-specific bar dedicated exclusively to hard rock, creating a community-driven space for passionate fans to connect.</li>
			<li class="text-white">Regular live performances offering aspiring artists an exclusive stage to showcase their music.</li>
			<li class="text-white">Offering an authentic and immersive atmosphere aligned closely with the brand identity of celebrating and revitalizing the hard rock culture, distinguishing it from generic music venues.</li>
          </ul>
          
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Age:  Predominantly between 25 to 55 years old, with a core male audience. However, recent trends show an increase in younger female fans actively engaging with hard rock.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Location: Primarily Utrecht-based, reflecting the local demand identified in our interviews. Dutch fans clearly indicated a desire for more dedicated hard rock venues within the Netherlands. </li>
			  <li class="text-white">Lifestyle: Passionate individuals who deeply value authenticity, personal expression, rebellion against norms, and genuine emotional connections. They actively participate in the live music scene, prioritizing experiences that reflect their identity.</li>
			  <li class="text-white">Behaviour: Social media savvy, frequently using Instagram and Facebook to stay updated on events, bands, and new music releases. They commonly discover new music through Spotify's algorithmic recommendations and rely on word-of-mouth within their community.</li>
			  <li class="text-white">Purchasing Habits: Regularly attend concerts and music events, investing primarily in tickets and physical music formats such as CDs and vinyl. They typically do not prioritize fashion merchandise, preferring purchases directly supporting their favourite artists’ music and performances. </li>
          </ul>
          
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white">Unique value proposition</p>
          <p class="text-white">A one-of-a-kind hard rock bar providing an authentic space for like-minded hard rock fans to connect in the modern world, offering an exclusive stage for upcoming bands and delivering the energy of live concerts without the high costs of major festivals.</p>
         
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white">Unfair advantage</p>

          <p class="text-white"><u>Social Media:</u> Using Instagram to visually showcase event highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, artist interactions, and engaging short-form content to attract younger fans.

Both platforms are key for fan interaction, building excitement, and maintaining regular communication with our audience.</p>

			 <li class="text-white">Additional income will come from merchandise sales, sourced directly from the performing bands, allowing fans to support artists and providing a supplementary revenue channel.</li>
			  <li class="text-white">Finally, occasional ticket sales for exclusive, high-profile guest performances.</li>
          </ul>
          
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white">Cost structure</p>
          <ol>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2 text-white">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p class="text-white">We first conducted a brainstorming session to create our brand name, during which we quickly recognized that our initial ideas were too stereotypical and did not accurately represent the authentic spirit of hard rock. Early suggestions such as "Stairway Suites," "Highway to Rest," "Bohemian Haven," and "The Rolling Stays" drew too heavily from famous rock bands, reinforcing clichés rather than originality. <br>
	      <br>  
		  To improve our approach, we began conducting research on search engines into the essential qualities of hard rock music to help guide our naming process. Despite this, many subsequent ideas, like "The Blackout," "Inferno Suites," "The Shadow Chord," "Grindstone Rock," "The Phantom Riff," "The Backstage," and "The SoundStay," still felt overly predictable or niche-specific, highlighting our limited experience with the genre. <br>
		  <br>
          Seeking external input, we reached out on Reddit for perspectives from dedicated hard rock fans. While these insights were informative about our audience needs, they did not directly yield usable name ideas. However, a spontaneous interaction within our group, inspired by a playful name of our WhatsApp chat "Rock 'n Roll Baby," sparked interest in using " 'n' " between two key thematic words. <br>
		  <br>
          After numerous attempts, Ariana suggested "Booze" to reflect the bar and music event concept we envisioned, and Lara then added "Bands" to signify the music element. Initially, "Booze 'N' Bands" received mixed reactions, but upon further reflection and after repeated use, the name resonated and was ultimately chosen. <br>
          <br>
          Regarding our trademark design, we created a mood board focusing on a rugged aesthetic with either a hand-brushed or spray-painted font style. <br>
			  <br>
		  <img src="images/corporate/moodboard.png" width="760" height="360" alt=""/> <br>
			  <br>
			Although we explored available fonts in Adobe Illustrator, none captured our intended visual identity. Consequently, Nicole, who has expertise in Adobe Illustrator, created a custom hand-drawn font that perfectly aligned with our original vision: a rough, authentic style with each word positioned on separate lines. <br>
			  <br>

			  <img src="images/corporate/font2.png" width="400" height="380" alt=""/> <br>
			 <br>
			Additionally, we experimented with creative touches such as incorporating lightning imagery or stylizing the "Z" in "Booze," but ultimately decided to maintain uniformity and consistency in colour and style throughout the design. <br>
