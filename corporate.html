			<p class="text-white">
				<strong class="text-white">Understanding Our Target Audience: Hard Rock Fans Aged 25-35 and 35-55</strong><br>
				<br>

				Hard rock fans come from diverse backgrounds, but they share a deep emotional and energetic connection to the music. Our target audience consists of two primary groups: younger fans (25-35) who embrace modern and innovative sounds, and older fans (35-55) who have a strong attachment to classic hard rock. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Younger Hard Rock Fans (25-35)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Many hard rock fans discover the genre in their teens or early 20s, often through platforms like Spotify and YouTube, where they are drawn to the genre's high energy, instrument-heavy compositions, the fusion of traditional hard rock with more contemporary sounds and lyrics connected to the real world, such as an album called “American Idiot” by Green Day. These fans actively seek out new music through playlists, social media, especially on TikTok and Instagram, and word-of-mouth recommendations. They also enjoy attending live concerts and festivals, preferring immersive experiences that allow them to connect with both the music and the community. While hard rock is a strong music preference, it doesn’t define their entire lifestyle, and they value authenticity in branding, though they tend to shy away from traditional hard rock fashion. What they want most is greater visibility for modern hard rock, exclusive events, and online content align with both age groups. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Older Hard Rock Fans (35-55)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Lifelong hard rock fans, many of whom grew up during the genre's peak in the '70s and '80s, are deeply connected to legendary bands like Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and AC/DC. They are drawn to the nostalgic, high-energy elements of hard rock, with a particular fondness for ballads and orchestral rock styles alongside the heavier sounds. Their music discovery largely comes from radio, YouTube, Facebook and word-of-mouth, preferring long-form content such as album reviews and band interviews over quick, bite-sized media. While they still value live concerts, they attend fewer shows, often enjoying cover bands and classic rock nights. Hard rock has long been a passion rather than an active lifestyle, and while traditional rock fashion doesn’t appeal to them, they appreciate quality band merchandise and memorabilia, they often enjoy CDs and vinyl records. They seek a balance between classic nostalgia and fresh innovation, remaining open to new bands, though finding them can be a challenge. Immersive musical journeys, comprehensive explorations of rock's evolution, and special access gatherings could rekindle their passion for the genre. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Key Takeaways for Positioning </strong><br>
				<br>
				To appeal to both younger and older hard rock fans, the bar should feature a mix of classic anthems and newer rock selections. The atmosphere should balance hard rock's rebellious energy with modern aesthetics, avoiding clichés. Live events are essential, as both demographics value them; Classic Rock Nights with tribute acts for older fans, and Modern Rock Showcases for younger audiences, along with exclusive experiences like meetups and jam sessions. Digital connection through platforms like Instagram and Facebook should complement physical gatherings and experiences. Maintaining authenticity is essential—the establishment needs to embody genuine rock spirit rather than appearing overly polished or commercialized. <br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Why Such a Wide Target Audience?</strong> <br>
				<br>
				The rapid technological and cultural changes in modern society have created unprecedented disconnection between generations. Rapid technological advancements and increased societal mobility have led to significant differences in communication and lifestyle. Younger generations adopt diverse values and modern lifestyles, diverging from traditional norms. With longer life expectancies and accelerating societal change, more generations coexist with distinct experiences and perspectives. Evolving cultural norms, such as increased individualism, further widen the gap between younger and older generations, creating a divide that is arguably larger than at any point in history (Study Finds Widening Generation Gap, 2009) <br>
				<br>

				Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody. By engaging in music together, particularly hard rock, generations can overcome age-related barriers and deepen their connections  (The Power of Music in Connecting Generations, n.d.). <br>
				<br>
				
				The genre's ability to span generations is evident in its continued popularity. Iconic bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath continue to attract new, younger fans while maintaining their original audience. This multi-generational appeal allows people of different ages to bond over shared musical interests, fostering understanding and connection across generational divides. The enduring appeal of classic rock bands creates a unique opportunity for different age groups to find common ground, share experiences, and appreciate each other's musical tastes (Schobel, 2024).  <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Booze ‘n Bands @Utrecht</strong><br>
				<br>
				Utrecht is the perfect location for Booze N Bands, offering a central position in the Netherlands that makes it easily accessible for both local patrons and touring bands. The city's proximity to the renowned Herman Brood Academie, which nurtures emerging musical talent, allows for potential collaborations and performances from up-and-coming rock bands. Utrecht also boasts an established rock culture, with venues like Club Café Stairway to Heaven and an active metal community, yet there is an opportunity for a bar that blends classic and modern hard rock styles, setting us apart and offering a one-of-a-kind experience. The city's growing tourism and vibrant cultural scene attract diverse crowds, providing an ideal setting to appeal to our target audience of hard rock fans aged 25-35 and 35-55. Younger fans, who gravitate toward new, innovative rock sounds, and older fans, who cherish the genre's classic anthems, will both find a space to connect, making Utrecht an ideal hub for bridging generational gaps and creating a unique, intergenerational music experience. Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody.

		  <p class="text-white"> <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/shared?id=%2Fpersonal%2F230774%5Fbuas%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FLet%27s%20rock%20and%20roll%20baby%21%2FInterviews&listurl=%2Fpersonal%2F230774%5Fbuas%5Fnl%2FDocuments&noAuthRedirect=1">All</a> interviews conducted are with this link.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white"> <strong>Market Segmentation</strong><br>
				<br>
<u>Demographics:</u> <br>
				<br>
Based on research by Taylor (2024), rock is the favourite musical style of the ages 16 to 29, 30 to 49 and 50 to 64. Based on research and out interviews it's clear that rock is an ageless music genre, appreciated by many and all. Therefore, we decided to target people ages 25-35 and 35-55 to maximize our efforts. <br>
				<br>

Gender within hard rock is predominantly male, but female hard rock fans are a growing segment, especially among younger listeners. Traditionally, because rock music is seen as being predominantly male, with lyrics focused on themes such as sex and drugs it can alienate female audiences (John, 2023). <br>
				<br>

Income Level is usually middle to upper-middle income, as hard rock fans often invest in concert tickets, merchandise, vinyl records, and premium streaming subscriptions (Irwin, 2022).   <br>
				<br>

Education Level ranges from high school graduates to university-educated professionals.  <br>
				<br>
<u>Geographic:</u>  <br>
				<br>

In the Netherlands since 2010 there have been 4 545 hard rock concerts (Calendar. n.d.).   <br>
				<br>

As evidenced by events like the iconic "Monsters of Rock" festival in Tilburg, which drew 30,000 fans in 1988, Netherlands has many had rock fans. Additionally, the Netherlands is home to numerous hard rock and metal festivals, such as Dynamo Metal Fest and Into the Grave, which attract thousands of attendees annually1(Geerts, J. 2024).   <br>
				<br>

There are some rock themed bars in the Netherlands such as: Hard Rock Café in Amsterdam, Rockcafé Backstage in Nijmegen, Rockcafé taste in Groenlo however the offer that exist currently is relatively small. For example, comparing the Netherlands to the US, the amount of Hard Rock Cafés in the US is 31 and, in the Netherlands, only the Hard Rock Café in Amsterdam exists (Hard Rock Café, n.d.). This is only a comparison of the amount of Hard Rock Cafés and not even of the other rock-themed bars in the US. This indicates that the offer for such bars is small in the Netherlands.   <br>
				<br>

A lot of interviewees mentioned that they either know or like the Hard Rock Café brand and that they miss more bars like that in the Netherlands. This makes the Netherlands the ultimate place to locate the Booze ‘N’ Bands bar, as the competition is rather small and our interviewees showed a high-demand for a rock-themed bar.    <br>
				<br> 

<u>Psychographic:</u>   <br>
				<br>

According to our interviews, their values are authenticity, freedom, rebellion, and individuality. They often admire the raw expression of emotions and the anti-establishment lyrics. The lifestyle of many fans is attending live shows and music festivals. Based on our interviews we realized most people’s motivations are that they are seeking a sense of belonging and emotional release and it connects a lot with nostalgia. A lot of interviewees stated that they like listening to hard rock as it gives them a positive energetic feeling, this really helps them for example with finishing a hard task. Most people enjoy sharing their music experiences with others, but not necessarily for the purpose of belonging to a community.   <br>
				<br> 
<u>Behavioural:</u>   <br>
			  <br>

Music Consumption Habits   <br>
		  <ul class="text-white">
	<li>Our interviews have said that streaming platforms like Spotify are used for listening to music and checking their recommendations, and YouTube for daily listening likewise.</li>
	<li>They purchase vinyl records and CDs to support their favourite artists, however not all of them, which makes up 10% of the primary modes of music consumption (Wallach, 2023). </li>
	<li>They are active participants in concert culture such as attending gigs, festivals, and live shows. Either a few times a year or a month.  </li>
	<li>Our interviewees have said that they discover music through Spotify recommendations and word-of-mouth.</li>
		  </ul>

<u class="text-white">Digital Platforms Usage: </u>  <br>
		  <br>

<p class="text-white"> <i>Social Media:</i> Primarily active on Instagram (for band updates and behind-the-scenes content); the largest age group on Instagram is 25-34, making up 31.7% of all users (Revankar, 2025), Facebook (for event groups and rock fan communities); Facebook had approximately 2.989 billion monthly active users (DataReportal, n.d.), with a diverse user base, with 18-55+ year-olds active on the platform, each age group engaging differently—young users (18-24) stay connected but prefer other platforms, while older demographics (25-55+) use Facebook for career, lifestyle, news, and community engagement (Stroud, 2024), and YouTube for the music videos and for band content. Other platforms that were mentioned were TikTok and Reddit, however they were not as often mentioned as Facebook and Instagram. Therefore, our focus will be on Instagram and Facebook.  </p>  <br>

<p class="text-white">We've noticed that for people 20-35 they prefer short content, and behind the scenes videos whereas people ages 35-55 like longer videos such as interviews. </p>  <br>
			
<p class="text-white"> Most of our interviewees have said they spend time on social media either in the morning or in the evening after work.  </p>  <br>

<p class="text-white"> <i>Purchasing Behaviour:</i> many interviews have mentioned that they don’t buy merchandise specifically or engage in other fashion or hard rock-related activities, except for purchasing concert tickets and the CD or vinyl lovers. </p>  <br>

<p class="text-white"> <i>Event Attendance:</i> regular attendees of concerts and festivals, our interviewees have mentioned typically a few times a year or every few months. </p>  <br>

		  <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 text-white">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights about audience growth patterns. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. This helps us set more realistic benchmarks for the future. Moving forward, we'll leverage this understanding to create more impactful content and engagement approaches that acknowledge the evolving nature of audience building.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 text-white">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white">Based on what we have learned through this already, we will recalculate our objectives.
		  Looking at the initial campaign data, we can observe several key insights: </p>
		  <p class="text-white">
		  <ol>
			    <li class="text-white">Instagram significantly outperformed Facebook across all metrics (reach, views, engagement)</li>
				<li class="text-white">Interactive content had moderate engagement but could be optimized</li>
				<li class="text-white">Facebook reach remained consistently low throughout the campaign</li>
			    <li class="text-white">Our reels are too long, which does not keep the attention of our audience</li>
		  </ol>
			</p>
          <p class="text-white">Future Recommendations:
		  <ol class="text-white">
			  <li>Platform Strategy Refinement: Primary Focus on Instagram, Given the significantly higher engagement rates, allocate 70% of resources to Instagram and 30% to Facebook.</li>
			  <li>Content Optimization: Video-First Approach, Increase video content from 25% to 50% of all posts, emphasizing authentic behind-the-scenes footage. User-Generated Content Initiative, use more creative hashtags because we use the same hastags in every post. We could partner with featured bands to co-create content before and after performances.</li>
			  <li>Measurement and Analytics: Refined KPIs: Set more realistic growth targets based on logarithmic growth patterns. A/B Testing Schedule: Systematically test different posting times to optimize engagement. Conversion Tracking: Implement mechanisms to track social media influence on actual bar attendance</li>
			  <li>Visual Identity Consistency: Our current posts lack a cohesive visual language, when you look at the feed. We should develop a clear set of visual guidelines including consistent color filters, typography treatments, and branded elements that make our content immediately recognizable even without seeing our logo.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </p>
			
          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. We've also learned that our reels are too long, which fails to maintain audience attention, and that interactive content has potential but needs optimization to fully engage our target audience. Facebook's consistently low reach across all content types indicates we should recalibrate our platform strategy to prioritize where our audience is most responsive.</p>

  		  <p class="text-white"> <strong>Justifications of Our Social Media Posts</strong></p>
	  <p class="text-white">The Booze 'N’ Bands Instagram and Facebook feed reflects the gritty, high-energy vibe of a live music bar. The use of vibrant colors and handwritten typography captures the raw, rebellious spirit of the music while also setting us apart from the crowd. Mixing band photos, bar interiors, and graphic posters gives followers a full sense of the experience and what they can expect at the bar (music, drinks, food, and atmosphere). The posters serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, promoting events while reinforcing brand identity. Repeating the logo and using a consistent color palette creates visual cohesion across the feed. One thing we could improve is the overall layout, as some posts currently feel visually heavier than others, which slightly disrupts the balance of the grid. However, hard rock fans don’t like feeling like they’re being marketed to, and the feed’s spontaneous, unpolished energy helps us stand out. It's a visual experience designed to connect with our audience and leave a lasting impression.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <p class="text-white">Our research and interviews indicate that the hard rock genre has significantly declined in mainstream prominence compared to previous decades. This diminished visibility negatively affects both fans and aspiring musicians. Specifically, emerging hard rock bands face difficulties in securing venues to showcase their talent, as venues are hesitant to book lesser-known or new artists. Consequently, the pipeline for new talent within the genre has stagnated, hindering the overall growth and vitality of hard rock music. Existing hard rock concerts, festivals, and events have become increasingly expensive, limiting accessibility for dedicated fans and further isolating the community from engaging fully with the music they love.</p>
		  
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">An intimate, genre-specific bar dedicated exclusively to hard rock, creating a community-driven space for passionate fans to connect.</li>
			<li class="text-white">Regular live performances offering aspiring artists an exclusive stage to showcase their music.</li>
			<li class="text-white">Offering an authentic and immersive atmosphere aligned closely with the brand identity of celebrating and revitalizing the hard rock culture, distinguishing it from generic music venues.</li>

			  <li class="text-white">Lifestyle: Passionate individuals who deeply value authenticity, personal expression, rebellion against norms, and genuine emotional connections. They actively participate in the live music scene, prioritizing experiences that reflect their identity.</li>
			  <li class="text-white">Behaviour: Social media savvy, frequently using Instagram and Facebook to stay updated on events, bands, and new music releases. They commonly discover new music through Spotify's algorithmic recommendations and rely on word-of-mouth within their community.</li>
			  <li class="text-white">Purchasing Habits: Regularly attend concerts and music events, investing primarily in tickets and physical music formats such as CDs and vinyl. They typically do not prioritize fashion merchandise, preferring purchases directly supporting their favourite artists’ music and performances. </li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2 text-white">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p class="text-white">We first conducted a brainstorming session to create our brand name, during which we quickly recognized that our initial ideas were too stereotypical and did not accurately represent the authentic spirit of hard rock. Early suggestions such as "Stairway Suites," "Highway to Rest," "Bohemian Haven," and "The Rolling Stays" drew too heavily from famous rock bands, reinforcing clichés rather than originality. <br>
	      <br>  
		  To improve our approach, we began conducting research on search engines into the essential qualities of hard rock music to help guide our naming process. Despite this, many subsequent ideas, like "The Blackout," "Inferno Suites," "The Shadow Chord," "Grindstone Rock," "The Phantom Riff," "The Backstage," and "The SoundStay," still felt overly predictable or niche-specific, highlighting our limited experience with the genre. <br>
		  <br>
          Seeking external input, we reached out on Reddit for perspectives from dedicated hard rock fans. While these insights were informative about our audience needs, they did not directly yield usable name ideas. However, a spontaneous interaction within our group, inspired by a playful name of our WhatsApp chat "Rock 'n Roll Baby," sparked interest in using " 'n' " between two key thematic words. <br>
		  <br>
          After numerous attempts, Ariana suggested "Booze" to reflect the bar and music event concept we envisioned, and Lara then added "Bands" to signify the music element. Initially, "Booze 'N' Bands" received mixed reactions, but upon further reflection and after repeated use, the name resonated and was ultimately chosen. <br>
          <br>
          Regarding our trademark design, we created a mood board focusing on a rugged aesthetic with either a hand-brushed or spray-painted font style. <br>
			  <br>
		  <img src="images/corporate/moodboard.png" width="760" height="360" alt=""/> <br>
			  <br>
			Although we explored available fonts in Adobe Illustrator, none captured our intended visual identity. Consequently, Nicole, who has expertise in Adobe Illustrator, created a custom hand-drawn font that perfectly aligned with our original vision: a rough, authentic style with each word positioned on separate lines. <br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/corporate/font1.png" width="400" height="340" alt=""/> 
			  <img src="images/corporate/font2.png" width="400" height="380" alt=""/> <br>
			 <br>
			Additionally, we experimented with creative touches such as incorporating lightning imagery or stylizing the "Z" in "Booze," but ultimately decided to maintain uniformity and consistency in colour and style throughout the design. <br>
			  <br>
