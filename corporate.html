	 <h4 id="content-1" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Brand Name and Logo</h4>
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Underneath is our logo, which also contains our brand name. Since our product is a bar, where hard rock fans can enjoy live music and nice drinks together, we wanted a name that reflected this. We began with a brainstorming session but quickly realized that early ideas were too cliché and did not reflect the true spirit of hard rock and our brand. Research into the genre and audience feedback helped refine our direction, though many suggestions still felt too predictable. Eventually we got inspired by the phrase rock 'n' roll, which led to the idea of using " 'n' " to link two bold concepts. "Booze" captured the bar and nightlife vibe, while "Bands" highlighted the music focus. The name "Booze 'N' Bands" struck the right balance: raw, memorable, and full of energy.</p>
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">For the logo and font, we built a mood board focused on rugged, rebellious aesthetics, since this was mentioned a lot by our target audience. We chose hand-brushed or spray-painted styles to reflect the gritty, unpolished vibe of rock. The final look feels loud, fun, and true to the hard rock scene we aim to celebrate.</p>

	<h4 id="content-2" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Brand Personas</h4>
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">After searching for possible interviewees and conducting those interviews, we noticed that we had a wide target audience in terms of age. With this in mind, we conducted desk research to see which ages like hard rock the most, to see if our assumption of this wide audience was correct. Based on research by Taylor (2024), rock is the favourite musical style of the ages 16 to 29, 30 to 49 and 50 to 64. This validated our assumption that hard rock is an almost ageless genre, that is loved by a wide target audience. Eventually based on our interviews, we decided to focus on an audience in the age-range of 25-55. As the age differences are pretty big, we had to make three different personas, each reflecting the personalities of a certain age-group within this wide target audience. </p>

        </p>
          
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">The visual identity of Booze ‘N’ Bands is loud, bold, and packed with attitude just like hard rock itself. Its main font is hand-drawn and full of wild energy, giving the brand a gritty, rebellious feel. It speaks to people who love live rock music. The color palette uses striking shades like bright red, electric blue, and neon green, balanced with deep blacks and dark blues to create a balanced, eye-catching, coherent look. These colors bring intensity and excitement that match the spirit of a rock concert. The lightning bolt graphics and brushstroke elements add movement and energy to the design, making it feel fast-paced and powerful, like a guitar solo mid-concert. The mood board supports this feeling with posters, bold lettering, and visual styles taken from punk and rock culture. The rough, edgy look is intentional as it makes the brand feel more raw and real. The second font is clean and simple, making sure information is easy to read while letting the bold design elements stand out. Altogether, the visual style of Booze ‘N’ Bands captures the feeling of a loud, thrilling night filled with music, energy, and attitude.</p>	
	 
	  <h4 id="content-4" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Supporting Visuals</h4>
		 <p class="text-white questrial-regular">As explained in the visual identity section, we wanted to give our brand a loud, bold, gritty and rebellious feel. That is why the supporting visuals used throughout the website are all contain bold color choices and pictures and videos all have a grainy effect over them. We have also decided to place a red hue over all the pictures, to ensure consistency and to bring the red color from our color pallette back into the design. At first we also had red containers, but in combination with the blue and the green, it was a bit too much design wise. The supporting visuals can be seen throughout the website. The pictures and videos that are stock footage are from Unsplash and Pexels, the credits for these can be found in the production section of this corporate page.</p>

		   <li class="text-white">We first started with the dark subcolors as our main colors, however after testing this out with how it looked on overlay of pictures and overlaying each other, we noticed that is was hard to read/see. That is why we introduced the main colors that we have now. They are derived from the subcolors, but have a brighter appearance, this ensures better readibility when overlayed on pictures or other colors. On top of that, this was suitable to our visual identity, as the color combinations on the website now are very bold.</li>

			<p class="text-white">
				<strong class="text-white">Understanding Our Target Audience: Hard Rock Fans Aged 25-35 and 35-55</strong><br>
				<br>

				Hard rock fans come from diverse backgrounds, but they share a deep emotional and energetic connection to the music. Our target audience consists of two primary groups: younger fans (25-35) who embrace modern and innovative sounds, and older fans (35-55) who have a strong attachment to classic hard rock. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Younger Hard Rock Fans (25-35)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Many hard rock fans discover the genre in their teens or early 20s, often through platforms like Spotify and YouTube, where they are drawn to the genre's high energy, instrument-heavy compositions, the fusion of traditional hard rock with more contemporary sounds and lyrics connected to the real world, such as an album called “American Idiot” by Green Day. These fans actively seek out new music through playlists, social media, especially on TikTok and Instagram, and word-of-mouth recommendations. They also enjoy attending live concerts and festivals, preferring immersive experiences that allow them to connect with both the music and the community. While hard rock is a strong music preference, it doesn’t define their entire lifestyle, and they value authenticity in branding, though they tend to shy away from traditional hard rock fashion. What they want most is greater visibility for modern hard rock, exclusive events, and online content align with both age groups. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Older Hard Rock Fans (35-55)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Lifelong hard rock fans, many of whom grew up during the genre's peak in the '70s and '80s, are deeply connected to legendary bands like Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and AC/DC. They are drawn to the nostalgic, high-energy elements of hard rock, with a particular fondness for ballads and orchestral rock styles alongside the heavier sounds. Their music discovery largely comes from radio, YouTube, Facebook and word-of-mouth, preferring long-form content such as album reviews and band interviews over quick, bite-sized media. While they still value live concerts, they attend fewer shows, often enjoying cover bands and classic rock nights. Hard rock has long been a passion rather than an active lifestyle, and while traditional rock fashion doesn’t appeal to them, they appreciate quality band merchandise and memorabilia, they often enjoy CDs and vinyl records. They seek a balance between classic nostalgia and fresh innovation, remaining open to new bands, though finding them can be a challenge. Immersive musical journeys, comprehensive explorations of rock's evolution, and special access gatherings could rekindle their passion for the genre. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Key Takeaways for Positioning </strong><br>
				<br>
				To appeal to both younger and older hard rock fans, the bar should feature a mix of classic anthems and newer rock selections. The atmosphere should balance hard rock's rebellious energy with modern aesthetics, avoiding clichés. Live events are essential, as both demographics value them; Classic Rock Nights with tribute acts for older fans, and Modern Rock Showcases for younger audiences, along with exclusive experiences like meetups and jam sessions. Digital connection through platforms like Instagram and Facebook should complement physical gatherings and experiences. Maintaining authenticity is essential—the establishment needs to embody genuine rock spirit rather than appearing overly polished or commercialized. <br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Why Such a Wide Target Audience?</strong> <br>
				<br>
				The rapid technological and cultural changes in modern society have created unprecedented disconnection between generations. Rapid technological advancements and increased societal mobility have led to significant differences in communication and lifestyle. Younger generations adopt diverse values and modern lifestyles, diverging from traditional norms. With longer life expectancies and accelerating societal change, more generations coexist with distinct experiences and perspectives. Evolving cultural norms, such as increased individualism, further widen the gap between younger and older generations, creating a divide that is arguably larger than at any point in history (Study Finds Widening Generation Gap, 2009) <br>
				<br>

				Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody. By engaging in music together, particularly hard rock, generations can overcome age-related barriers and deepen their connections  (The Power of Music in Connecting Generations, n.d.). <br>
				<br>
				
				The genre's ability to span generations is evident in its continued popularity. Iconic bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath continue to attract new, younger fans while maintaining their original audience. This multi-generational appeal allows people of different ages to bond over shared musical interests, fostering understanding and connection across generational divides. The enduring appeal of classic rock bands creates a unique opportunity for different age groups to find common ground, share experiences, and appreciate each other's musical tastes (Schobel, 2024).  <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Booze ‘n Bands @Utrecht</strong><br>
				<br>
				Utrecht is the perfect location for Booze N Bands, offering a central position in the Netherlands that makes it easily accessible for both local patrons and touring bands. The city's proximity to the renowned Herman Brood Academie, which nurtures emerging musical talent, allows for potential collaborations and performances from up-and-coming rock bands. Utrecht also boasts an established rock culture, with venues like Club Café Stairway to Heaven and an active metal community, yet there is an opportunity for a bar that blends classic and modern hard rock styles, setting us apart and offering a one-of-a-kind experience. The city's growing tourism and vibrant cultural scene attract diverse crowds, providing an ideal setting to appeal to our target audience of hard rock fans aged 25-35 and 35-55. Younger fans, who gravitate toward new, innovative rock sounds, and older fans, who cherish the genre's classic anthems, will both find a space to connect, making Utrecht an ideal hub for bridging generational gaps and creating a unique, intergenerational music experience. Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody. By engaging in music together, particularly hard rock, generations can overcome age-related barriers and deepen their connections (The Power of Music in Connecting Generations, n.d.). <br>

				<p class="mt-4 text-white"><strong>Target Audience - Interviews/Research</strong></p>
				
		  <p class="text-white"> <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/shared?id=%2Fpersonal%2F230774%5Fbuas%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FLet%27s%20rock%20and%20roll%20baby%21%2FInterviews&listurl=%2Fpersonal%2F230774%5Fbuas%5Fnl%2FDocuments&noAuthRedirect=1">All</a> interviews conducted are with this link.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white"><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
			  <p class="text-white"><u>Demographics:</u></p>
			    <p class="text-white">Based on research by Taylor (2024), rock is the favourite musical style of the ages 16 to 29, 30 to 49 and 50 to 64. Based on research and out interviews it's clear that rock is an ageless music genre, appreciated by many and all. Therefore, we decided to target people ages 25-35 and 35-55 to maximize our efforts.</p>
			    <p class="text-white">Gender within hard rock is predominantly male, but female hard rock fans are a growing segment, especially among younger listeners. Traditionally, because rock music is seen as being predominantly male, with lyrics focused on themes such as sex and drugs it can alienate female audiences (John, 2023).</p>
			    <p class="text-white">Income Level is usually middle to upper-middle income, as hard rock fans often invest in concert tickets, merchandise, vinyl records, and premium streaming subscriptions (Irwin, 2022).</p>
			    <p class="text-white">Education Level ranges from high school graduates to university-educated professionals.</p>
			<p class="text-white"><u>Geographics:</u></p>
			    <p class="text-white">In the Netherlands since 2010 there have been 4 545 hard rock concerts (Calendar. n.d.).</p>
			    <p class="text-white">As evidenced by events like the iconic "Monsters of Rock" festival in Tilburg, which drew 30,000 fans in 1988, Netherlands has many had rock fans. Additionally, the Netherlands is home to numerous hard rock and metal festivals, such as Dynamo Metal Fest and Into the Grave, which attract thousands of attendees annually (Geerts, J. 2024).</p>
			    <p class="text-white">There are some rock themed bars in the Netherlands such as: Hard Rock Café in Amsterdam, Rockcafé Backstage in Nijmegen, Rockcafé taste in Groenlo however the offer that exist currently is relatively small. For example, comparing the Netherlands to the US, the amount of Hard Rock Cafés in the US is 31 and, in the Netherlands, only the Hard Rock Café in Amsterdam exists (Hard Rock Café, n.d.). This is only a comparison of the amount of Hard Rock Cafés and not even of the other rock-themed bars in the US. This indicates that the offer for such bars is small in the Netherlands.</p>
			    <p class="text-white">A lot of interviewees mentioned that they either know or like the Hard Rock Café brand and that they miss more bars like that in the Netherlands. This makes the Netherlands the ultimate place to locate the Booze ‘N’ Bands bar, as the competition is rather small and our interviewees showed a high-demand for a rock-themed bar.</p>
			<p class="text-white"><u>Psychographic:</u></p>
			   <p class="text-white">According to our interviews, their values are authenticity, freedom, rebellion, and individuality. They often admire the raw expression of emotions and the anti-establishment lyrics. The lifestyle of many fans is attending live shows and music festivals. Based on our interviews we realized most people’s motivations are that they are seeking a sense of belonging and emotional release and it connects a lot with nostalgia. A lot of interviewees stated that they like listening to hard rock as it gives them a positive energetic feeling, this really helps them for example with finishing a hard task. Most people enjoy sharing their music experiences with others, but not necessarily for the purpose of belonging to a community.</p>
			<p class="text-white"><u>Behavioural</u></p>
			   <p class="text-white">Music Consumption Habits:</p>
		         <ul class="text-white">
	                <li>Our interviews have said that streaming platforms like Spotify are used for listening to music and checking their recommendations, and YouTube for daily listening likewise.</li>
	                <li>They purchase vinyl records and CDs to support their favourite artists, however not all of them, which makes up 10% of the primary modes of music consumption (Wallach, 2023). </li>
	                <li>They are active participants in concert culture such as attending gigs, festivals, and live shows. Either a few times a year or a month.  </li>
	                <li>Our interviewees have said that they discover music through Spotify recommendations and word-of-mouth.</li>
		         </ul>
			
			<p class="text-white">Digital Platforms Usage:</p>
			  <p class="text-white"><i>Social Media:</i> Primarily active on Instagram (for band updates and behind-the-scenes content); the largest age group on Instagram is 25-34, making up 31.7% of all users (Revankar, 2025), Facebook (for event groups and rock fan communities); Facebook had approximately 2.989 billion monthly active users (DataReportal, n.d.), with a diverse user base, with 18-55+ year-olds active on the platform, each age group engaging differently—young users (18-24) stay connected but prefer other platforms, while older demographics (25-55+) use Facebook for career, lifestyle, news, and community engagement (Stroud, 2024), and YouTube for the music videos and for band content. Other platforms that were mentioned were TikTok and Reddit, however they were not as often mentioned as Facebook and Instagram. Therefore, our focus will be on Instagram and Facebook.</p>  
		  <p class="text-white">We've noticed that for people 20-35 they prefer short content, and behind the scenes videos whereas people ages 35-55 like longer videos such as interviews. </p>
			  <p class="text-white">Most of our interviewees have said they spend time on social media either in the morning or in the evening after work.</p>
			  <p class="text-white"><i>Purchasing Behaviour:</i> many interviews have mentioned that they don’t buy merchandise specifically or engage in other fashion or hard rock-related activities, except for purchasing concert tickets and the CD or vinyl lovers.</p>
			  <p class="text-white"><i>Event Attendance:</i> regular attendees of concerts and festivals, our interviewees have mentioned typically a few times a year or every few months. </p>

		 <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 text-white">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights about audience growth patterns. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. This helps us set more realistic benchmarks for the future. Moving forward, we'll leverage this understanding to create more impactful content and engagement approaches that acknowledge the evolving nature of audience building.</p>

			<p class="text-white"><u>Learning Week 1:</u></p>
		  <p class="text-white">In the first week, we prioritized rapid exposure by immediately sharing our Instagram account with friends, family, and by actively engaging with the hard rock fan community. This direct approach sparked a notable initial growth in followers and visibility. However, the performance analytics of our first reel—despite being nearly a minute long—revealed an average view time of only 11 seconds. This was a clear indicator that our video content strategy needed refinement. Based on these insights, we adjusted our approach by producing shorter, more dynamic reels designed to grab attention instantly and sustain viewer interest. Although the early reel results were not as strong as expected, we successfully achieved our week one objectives. This was largely driven by the intrigue and anticipation we generated—the tension of the unknown worked in our favor, sparking curiosity and engagement.</p>

Sharing the menu allowed us to showcase the vibe and offerings, further building excitement for the brand’s physical experience. </p>

			<p class="text-white"><u>Learning Week 2:</u></p>
			<p class="text-white">In Week 2, our strategy shifted from intrigue to credibility, focusing on involving our audience more directly. We revealed the physical location of our bar and shared a sign logo mockup, bringing our vision to life and building anticipation.</p>
			<p class="text-white">We then posted our house rules in a carousel to set expectations, emphasizing that Booze 'n' Bands is an adult-only bar. This helped reinforce our brand identity and align with our audience on the kind of environment we’re creating. </p>
			<p class="text-white">To maintain engagement, we asked followers which artists or bands they'd like to see at our venue using the "write something" sticker in a story. However, engagement was higher when we used a poll in Week 1. This suggests that while followers want to have input, they prefer less effort on their part, indicating that simpler engagement formats work best. </p>
			<p class="text-white">Despite slightly lower reach compared to Week 1, we still saw quality engagement, including saves and comments. Week 2 helped solidify our brand identity, and we learned the importance of balancing audience participation with ease of engagement.</p>
			
		 <p class="text-white"><u>Week 3 (24/03/25 - 30/03/2025):</u></p>	
		 <p class="text-white">24/03: Grand Opening:</p>
			<p class="text-white">We posted the official announcement of our Booze 'n' Bands grand opening, sharing the exact date with our followers. This was a key moment in building excitement and anticipation for the big day, marking the countdown to the next phase of our brand’s journey.</p>

			<p class="text-white">26/03: Win 2 tickets:</p>
			<p class="text-white">We posted a short 19-second video explaining how followers could win free beer on our opening night. Drawing from our Week 1 insight, that our audience has a short attention span, we intentionally kept the video brief and to the point, aiming to boost retention and encourage interaction.</p>
			<p class="text-white">Post metrics:</p>

			<p class="text-white">28/03: Guess the lyrics:</p>
			<p class="text-white">We shared another interactive story, this time using a poll format to let followers guess the lyrics of a well-known rock song. Based on insights from Week 2, we returned to using polls, as they had previously shown higher engagement than open-ended stickers. This quick and low-effort interaction proved more effective once again.</p>

			  </ul>
			<p class="text-white">This marked a clear improvement over the open-ended engagement format used in Week 2, reinforcing that our audience prefers simple, tap-based interactions that require minimal effort.</p>
			
			
			<p class="text-white"><u>Learning Week 3:</u></p>
			<p class="text-white">In Week 3, our marketing strategy focused on creating excitement through engaging content, including the grand opening announcement, a giveaway, and interactive stories. Unfortunately, the results didn’t align with our expectations. While our follower counts increased, engagement metrics such as likes and interactions remained consistent with Week 1. This showed that our assumption that engagement would rise alongside our growing follower base was incorrect.</p>
			<p class="text-white">After analyzing the performance of our Week 1 reel (56 seconds long), which had an average watch time of 11 seconds, we decided to shorten our Week 3 reel to 19 seconds. Despite the average watch time remaining at 6 seconds for the Week 3 reel, we recognize that viewers are actually consuming a larger percentage of the content. In Week 1, viewers watched only about 20% of the reel, whereas in Week 3, they watched approximately 31% of the reel. This suggests that while total watch time may not have increased, viewers are engaging with a more significant portion of the video. On top of all of this we also did not meet our set objectives.</p>

			<p class="text-white"><u>Learning Week 4:</u></p>
			<p class="text-white">The key takeaway from Week 4 is that while we are making strides in promoting our brand’s various aspects, we need to better understand what truly drives engagement with our audience. It’s important to fine-tune our approach, focusing on creating content that offers more immediate value and deeper connections with our followers. Moving forward, we will experiment with different formats and calls to action to see what best sparks interest and interaction.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white"><strong>Summary of Learnings Instagram</strong></p>
			  <p class="text-white">At the start, we focused on creating longer-form reels to introduce our brand. However, we quickly learned from the performance of our first reel—where the average watch time was just 11 seconds on a 1-minute video—that our audience had a short attention span. In response, we shortened the length of our reels, making them more dynamic and immediate, aligning with the preferences of our followers. While the results were still mixed, this tactical change was essential in improving engagement.</p>
			  <p class="text-white">Initially, we experienced high engagement levels, especially when using interactive formats like polls and quizzes. For instance, the poll on 14/03 (“Guess our product?”) and the interactive poll on 28/03 (“Guess the lyrics”) proved successful, with the latter showing significantly higher engagement than similar posts from Week 2. These insights emphasized that our audience thrives on low-effort interactions such as tapping on a poll, rather than open-ended responses or more complex story formats.</p>
			  <p class="text-white">However, as we progressed, the overall engagement began to decline, with later posts like our "Grand Opening" announcement (24/03) and the "Food and Drinks Menu" post (23/03) seeing lower interaction rates. This decline is understandable as the novelty of early posts began to wear off, and followers started to lose interest, or perhaps their attention was divided.</p>
			  <p class="text-white">While we initially experienced rapid follower growth by sharing our Instagram account with friends and family and actively engaging with the hard rock fan community, we noticed that follower growth slowed down after the first few weeks. This shift in follower acquisition is a common pattern in social media growth, where an initial surge is followed by a more gradual and organic increase. As we approach a more established community, we now understand that growth will likely continue at a more measured pace, and our benchmarks need to be adjusted accordingly. Going forward, we will need to prioritize quality over quantity in follower acquisition.</p>
			  <p class="text-white">Another challenge that emerged as we continued posting was the appearance of our feed. Over time, with multiple posts on different days, the aesthetic cohesion of the feed started to suffer. The content became slightly disjointed, with posts ranging from logos to rules to behind-the-scenes sneak peeks. While this content was valuable, it made the feed feel cluttered and lacked a consistent visual flow. </p>
			  <p class="text-white">To improve this, we could consider a more structured content calendar that integrates cohesive visuals and more balanced post formats. Planning for consistent themes or colors, as well as spacing out post types (e.g., reels, static images, carousels), could help maintain a cleaner, more attractive feed.</p>
			  <p class="text-white">Lastly, in real life, if we were actually promoting a physical bar and not just promising it, we could have marketed with real images that captured the authentic vibe of the space less polished and more relatable, showcasing the true atmosphere we intend to create. This approach would have allowed us to present a more realistic and grounded experience for our followers. Additionally, we could have targeted our marketing efforts more specifically to a local audience in Utrecht, collaborating with nearby clubs, bars, and cafes to build a stronger community presence and increase word-of-mouth promotion. The inability to promote something tangible or real, such as the actual bar space, added a layer of challenge to our strategy, as we were working with abstract concepts and visuals, rather than a concrete product. This limitation affected how effectively we could connect with our audience on a deeper, more immediate level.</p>
			
			
			
         <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 text-white">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white">Based on what we have learned through this already, we will recalculate our objectives.
		  Looking at the initial campaign data, we can observe several key insights: </p>
		  
		  <ol>
			    <li class="text-white">Instagram significantly outperformed Facebook across all metrics (reach, views, engagement)</li>
				<li class="text-white">Interactive content had moderate engagement but could be optimized</li>
				<li class="text-white">Facebook reach remained consistently low throughout the campaign</li>
			    <li class="text-white">Our reels are too long, which does not keep the attention of our audience</li>
		  </ol>
			
          <p class="text-white">Future Recommendations:</p>
		  <ol class="text-white">
			  <li>Platform Strategy Refinement: Primary Focus on Instagram, Given the significantly higher engagement rates, allocate 70% of resources to Instagram and 30% to Facebook.</li>
			  <li>Content Optimization: Video-First Approach, Increase video content from 25% to 50% of all posts, emphasizing authentic behind-the-scenes footage. User-Generated Content Initiative, use more creative hashtags because we use the same hastags in every post. We could partner with featured bands to co-create content before and after performances.</li>
			  <li>Measurement and Analytics: Refined KPIs: Set more realistic growth targets based on logarithmic growth patterns. A/B Testing Schedule: Systematically test different posting times to optimize engagement. Conversion Tracking: Implement mechanisms to track social media influence on actual bar attendance</li>
			  <li>Visual Identity Consistency: Our current posts lack a cohesive visual language, when you look at the feed. We should develop a clear set of visual guidelines including consistent color filters, typography treatments, and branded elements that make our content immediately recognizable even without seeing our logo.</li>
		  </ol>
			
          <p class="text-white">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. We've also learned that our reels are too long, which fails to maintain audience attention, and that interactive content has potential but needs optimization to fully engage our target audience. Facebook's consistently low reach across all content types indicates we should recalibrate our platform strategy to prioritize where our audience is most responsive.</p>
          
			
			
		
	  	
  		  <p class="text-white"> <strong>Justifications of Our Social Media Posts</strong></p>
	  <p class="text-white">The Booze 'N’ Bands Instagram and Facebook feed reflects the gritty, high-energy vibe of a live music bar. The use of vibrant colors and handwritten typography captures the raw, rebellious spirit of the music while also setting us apart from the crowd. Mixing band photos, bar interiors, and graphic posters gives followers a full sense of the experience and what they can expect at the bar (music, drinks, food, and atmosphere). The posters serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, promoting events while reinforcing brand identity. Repeating the logo and using a consistent color palette creates visual cohesion across the feed. One thing we could improve is the overall layout, as some posts currently feel visually heavier than others, which slightly disrupts the balance of the grid. However, hard rock fans don’t like feeling like they’re being marketed to, and the feed’s spontaneous, unpolished energy helps us stand out. It's a visual experience designed to connect with our audience and leave a lasting impression.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <p class="text-white">Our research and interviews indicate that the hard rock genre has significantly declined in mainstream prominence compared to previous decades. This diminished visibility negatively affects both fans and aspiring musicians. Specifically, emerging hard rock bands face difficulties in securing venues to showcase their talent, as venues are hesitant to book lesser-known or new artists. Consequently, the pipeline for new talent within the genre has stagnated, hindering the overall growth and vitality of hard rock music. Existing hard rock concerts, festivals, and events have become increasingly expensive, limiting accessibility for dedicated fans and further isolating the community from engaging fully with the music they love.</p>
		  
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">An intimate, genre-specific bar dedicated exclusively to hard rock, creating a community-driven space for passionate fans to connect.</li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2 text-white">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p class="text-white">We first conducted a brainstorming session to create our brand name, during which we quickly recognized that our initial ideas were too stereotypical and did not accurately represent the authentic spirit of hard rock. Early suggestions such as "Stairway Suites," "Highway to Rest," "Bohemian Haven," and "The Rolling Stays" drew too heavily from famous rock bands, reinforcing clichés rather than originality. <br>
	      <br>  
		  To improve our approach, we began conducting research on search engines into the essential qualities of hard rock music to help guide our naming process. Despite this, many subsequent ideas, like "The Blackout," "Inferno Suites," "The Shadow Chord," "Grindstone Rock," "The Phantom Riff," "The Backstage," and "The SoundStay," still felt overly predictable or niche-specific, highlighting our limited experience with the genre. <br>
		  <br>
          Seeking external input, we reached out on Reddit for perspectives from dedicated hard rock fans. While these insights were informative about our audience needs, they did not directly yield usable name ideas. However, a spontaneous interaction within our group, inspired by a playful name of our WhatsApp chat "Rock 'n Roll Baby," sparked interest in using " 'n' " between two key thematic words. <br>
		  <br>
          After numerous attempts, Ariana suggested "Booze" to reflect the bar and music event concept we envisioned, and Lara then added "Bands" to signify the music element. Initially, "Booze 'N' Bands" received mixed reactions, but upon further reflection and after repeated use, the name resonated and was ultimately chosen. <br>
          <br>
          Regarding our trademark design, we created a mood board focusing on a rugged aesthetic with either a hand-brushed or spray-painted font style. <br>
			  <br>
		     <img src="images/corporate/moodboard.png" class ="img-fluid" width="760" height="360" alt="Mood Board"><br>
			  <br>
			      Although we explored available fonts in Adobe Illustrator, none captured our intended visual identity. Consequently, Nicole, who has expertise in Adobe Illustrator, created a custom hand-drawn font that perfectly aligned with our original vision: a rough, authentic style with each word positioned on separate lines. <br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/corporate/font1.png" class ="img-fluid" width="400" height="340" alt="Font One"> 
			  <img src="images/corporate/font2.png" class ="img-fluid" width="400" height="380" alt="Font Two"> <br>
			  <br>
			      Additionally, we experimented with creative touches such as incorporating lightning imagery or stylizing the "Z" in "Booze," but ultimately decided to maintain uniformity and consistency in colour and style throughout the design. <br>
