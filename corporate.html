	 <h4 id="content-1" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Brand Name and Logo</h4>
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Underneath is our logo, which also contains our brand name. Since our product is a bar, where hard rock fans can enjoy live music and nice drinks together, we wanted a name that reflected this. We began with a brainstorming session but quickly realized that early ideas were too cliché and did not reflect the true spirit of hard rock and our brand. Research into the genre and audience feedback helped refine our direction, though many suggestions still felt too predictable. Eventually we got inspired by the phrase rock 'n' roll, which led to the idea of using " 'n' " to link two bold concepts. "Booze" captured the bar and nightlife vibe, while "Bands" highlighted the music focus. The name "Booze 'N' Bands" struck the right balance: raw, memorable, and full of energy.</p>
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">For the logo and font, we built a mood board focused on rugged, rebellious aesthetics, since this was mentioned a lot by our target audience. We chose hand-brushed or spray-painted styles to reflect the gritty, unpolished vibe of rock. The final look feels loud, fun, and true to the hard rock scene we aim to celebrate.</p>

	<h4 id="content-2" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Brand Personas</h4>
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">After searching for possible interviewees and conducting those interviews, we noticed that we had a wide target audience in terms of age. With this in mind, we conducted desk research to see which ages like hard rock the most, to see if our assumption of this wide audience was correct. Based on research by Taylor (2024), rock is the favourite musical style of the ages 16 to 29, 30 to 49 and 50 to 64. This validated our assumption that hard rock is an almost ageless genre, that is loved by a wide target audience. Eventually based on our interviews, we decided to focus on an audience in the age-range of 25-55. As the age differences are pretty big, we had to make three different personas, each reflecting the personalities of a certain age-group within this wide target audience. The personas are created based on desk research as well as conducted problem interviews.</p>

			<img src="images/corporate/styleguide.png" class="img-fluid" width="600" alt="style guide">
          
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">The visual identity of Booze ‘N’ Bands is loud, bold, and packed with attitude just like hard rock itself. Its main font is hand-drawn and full of wild energy, giving the brand a gritty, rebellious feel. It speaks to people who love live rock music. The color palette uses striking shades like bright red, electric blue, and neon green, balanced with deep blacks and dark blues to create a balanced, eye-catching, coherent look. These colors bring intensity and excitement that match the spirit of a rock concert. The lightning bolt graphics and brushstroke elements add movement and energy to the design, making it feel fast-paced and powerful, like a guitar solo mid-concert. The mood board supports this feeling with posters, bold lettering, and visual styles taken from punk and rock culture. The rough, edgy look is intentional as it makes the brand feel more raw and real. The second font is clean and simple, making sure information is easy to read while letting the bold design elements stand out. Altogether, the visual style of Booze ‘N’ Bands captures the feeling of a loud, thrilling night filled with music, energy, and attitude.</p>	
	 
	  <h4 id="content-4" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Supporting Visuals</h4>
		 <p class="text-white questrial-regular">As explained in the visual identity section, we wanted to give our brand a loud, bold, gritty and rebellious feel. That is why the supporting visuals used throughout the website are all contain bold color choices and pictures and videos all have a grainy effect over them. We have also decided to place a red hue over all the pictures, to ensure consistency and to bring the red color from our color pallette back into the design. At first we also had red containers, but in combination with the blue and the green, it was a bit too much design wise. The supporting visuals can be seen throughout the website. The pictures and videos that are stock footage are from Unsplash and Pexels, the credits for these can be found in the production section of this corporate page.</p>

		   <li class="text-white">We first started with the dark subcolors as our main colors, however after testing this out with how it looked on overlay of pictures and overlaying each other, we noticed that is was hard to read/see. That is why we introduced the main colors that we have now. They are derived from the subcolors, but have a brighter appearance, this ensures better readibility when overlayed on pictures or other colors. On top of that, this was suitable to our visual identity, as the color combinations on the website now are very bold. Moreover, during the problem interviews we found out that the target audience is not looking for clichés in the brand identity. They emphasized a need for the use of brighter colors in combination with red.</li>

        <li class="text-white questrial-regular">
          <strong>Testing Goals</strong> – We aimed to discover whether users could easily navigate the site’s pages, understand the brand’s hard rock identity, and complete booking or information-related tasks without confusion. Specifically we aimed to discover the following things:
		   <ul>
			   <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Whether users can easily navigate the website and access key details about drinks, events, and reservations.</li>
			   <li class="text-white questrial-regular">If users find the online reservation and pre-order system intuitive and useful.</li>
			   <li class="text-white questrial-regular">How well the design and branding reflect the atmosphere of our bar.</li>

			 <strong>Our Testing Methods</strong>
             <ul>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>The test participants</strong> &ndash; we will use the same participants (8-9 people) as in our first round of interviews, to make sure we continue with a linear evaluation. Participants were selected since they have an affinity for hard rock and its music and fall within the age-demographic of the audience we are targeting. 
			   </li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>The test setting</strong> &ndash; Some tests will be conducted in person and others online for participants who can not attend in person. Each session lasts 10–15 minutes. During the test we will ask questions and let our users complete tasks on the website. Afterwards more questions will be asked on the general user experience. We will use the think-a-loud protocol and ask our participants to share their thoughts and opinions as they go through the website. Participants will use laptops, mobile phones, and tablets to ensure the site’s responsiveness across different devices. 
				</li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>The test's protocol</strong> &ndash; The test contains of three sections: introduction, task execution and feedback collection, which will be explained in further detail underneath.

	   <ul>
		   <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Test protocol</strong>
			   <ul>
				   <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Introduction:</u> Participants are given a brief overview of the test and its purpose.

						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">What’s your first impression of our website?</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Is the design visually appealing to you?</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Is the content structured in a nice overview or is it overwhelming?</li>
				   <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Task Execution:</u> Participants perform tasks while their screen interactions are observed and recorded. The tasks need to be executed with as little guidance from us as possible to not interfere with the findings and objectivity of the test.</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Find and navigate to the menu.</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Reserve a table at the bar.</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Find contact details and social media links.</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Check out artist schedule.</li>
						  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Find our brand values.</li>
			      <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Feedback Collection:</u> Immediately after each session, we ask the participants a series of questions that determine their experience.</li>
						 <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Can you find the most important information easily?</li>
						 <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Would you use our online reservation feature?</li>
						 <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Is there anything you would change or improve? Did you have any difficulties?</li>

	      <ul> 
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>High impact issues (affecting core usability):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">On mobile, the hamburger menu (important so the navigation bar still functions) was hard to see, because it was still black. On the navy blue background it was almost impossible to see.</li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">UX patterns that were part of the PRJ4 template were still present on the navigation bar on the thank you page, causing confusion.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">The text on the cocktail and bites menu card was difficult to read.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Light blue text on dark blue background in house rules section and brand value section was hard to read, especially for colorblind users.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
		   </ul>
			
			<ul> 
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Lower impact issues (affecting experience/clarity but not blocking use):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Clickable-looking visuals such as the lightning bolt and artists card on the artist schedule were not clickable, causing minor confusion.</li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Two users had some struggles with filling in the date on the reservation page, however recovered quickly.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Some found the text on the website too cramped or too small, especially on the menu page.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Navy blue and black were often not distinguished by users and some disliked the colour match of these two.</li>

	   <ul> 
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Suggestions for potential improvements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Add an artists suggestion feature on the website itself, instead of getting redirected to the socials.</li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Make the lightning bolts clickable, for example on the homepage if a user would click on the lightning bolt above the location to our bar it would lead to Google Maps.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Enhance the user experience and appeal on the artist schedule page, by making the cards clickable, redirecting immediately to the reservation page. Or by adding videos of the bands playing (potentially with including sounds).</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Use more red tones on the website as many connect this colour with the hard rock genre.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Add a section with user reviews or experiences to give website visitors more insight into the bar.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
		   </ul>

		 <ul> 
		  <li class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Improvements done (based on the testing results):</strong>
             <ul>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">The hamburger menu on the navigation bar is now white, making it visible on every device. We decided to already adjust this as this highly affected the usability of our website on a mobile device.</li>
                <li class="text-white questrial-regular">The UX patterns section on the navigation bar in the thankyou page has been deleted. This was also something that we decided to change as it was an easy fix because it was a small mistake to forget to delete this. Now it is deleted, user confusion will be avoided.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">We had multiple complaints that especially on the menu page the text felt really small and cramped. Therefore we decided to adapt this on that page, by making it bigger.</li>
              </ul>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Context of campaign and promotional activities done</h4>
			  
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Context of the campaign and promotional activities done:</strong> Booze 'N' Bands is the sanctuary where hard rock pulses through every corner. Hard rock isn't just music to us, it's in our blood, a living legacy we honor through quality drinks and authentic experiences. We bridge generations by celebrating the legends who built this sound while creating space for new talent to rise. Every night, we bring together those who understand that real rock never stands alone, creating a community where passion thrives in unity and the spirit of rebellion lives on. Booze 'N' Bands is a brand taloired for hard rock fans aged 25-55. As this target audience has a pretty big age-gap, we found out after desk research and interviews that their media consumption habits are also different, indicating that it was essential to use different social media platforms for our campaign. To promote our brand effectively, we used Instagram and Facebook, as they align with the demographics of our target audiences and offer the right content formats for engagement. All the content on Instagram and Facebook were the same and posted simultaneously at 19:00, as this is the time that our interviewees are most active on social media.These were also the two most mentioned platforms during our interviews. Our communication message goes as follows:  "Hard rock unites generations from past, present, and future. It’s the ultimate sound that connects us. Let’s honour the legends and amplify the next wave of talent, let’s continue the legacy!". We used this message as Booze 'N' Bands wants to reignite the classic hard rock spirit, while supporting new and upcoming hard rock artists. We aim to bridge the gap between nostalgia and innovation within the genre. With this campaign we aim to unite hard rock fans across generations by celebrating the legacy and introducing the audience to the innovations of the genre. That is why our content contained a mix of old hard rock and innovations within the genre. During the first week of promotion, our content strategy on Instagram and Facebook focused on introducing the brand, building anticipation, and engaging the audience through interactive content. After the first week, our content continued to build excitement. We featured artists performing at the bar, highlighted exclusive beer give aways, and paid tribute to hard rock legends who have shaped the hardrock genre. By posting rock legends, the audience was exposed to something familiar, our goal was to increase engagement with this post. Additionally, we shared pictures of the bar’s atmosphere as well as houserules, capturing the raw energy and immersive experience our venue offers. Lastly, our last two week were focused on an exciting event, the grand opening of the Booze 'N' Bands bar. We shared teasers, ticket give-aways and we boosted engagement by asking which artists should be performing at the grand opening. Each week we posted three times, with the exception of week 2, which contained four posts. Our main decision to post only three times a week was because after engaging with hard rock fans on Reddit, we noticed that they do not like being marketed to at all. Each week featured a variety of content, posts, carousels, stories and Reels.</p>
			  
			  
			  <p id="objectives" class="text-white mt-2 questrial-regular"><strong>Our Objectives:</strong></p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Our goal is to increase awareness in 4 weeks time of our new bar, Booze ‘N’ Bands, and attract more customers by promoting on social media. We aim to achieve this by posting three times a week on Instagram and Facebook over the next four weeks, measuring success through Instagram and Facebook's KPIs (impressions and reach). Our target is to generate 1800 views with Facebook and Instagram combined and engagement that translates into increased website views, ultimately contributing to the success of our business within this timeframe.</p>
			
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Outcome: After the forth week of our campaign we have 335 views of our Facebook page and a total of 2407 views of our Instagram page. This means that combined we have a total of 2742 views, meaning that we reached our objective on the amount of views.</p>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Reach objective Instagram:</u> By April 7, 2025, Booze 'N' Bands aims to reach at least 2,000 hard rock fans aged 25-35 on Instagram by focusing on Reels, Stories, and relevant hashtags.</p>
			    
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Reach objective Facebook:</u> By April 7, 2025, Booze 'N' Bands wants to reach at least 1600 hard rock fans aged 35-55 on Facebook by posting regularly and joining rock-related groups.</p>
			   
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Response objective Instagram:</u> By April 7, 2025 we aim to grow our Instagram page to at least 300 followers with a 0.90% click-through rate to our website.</p>
			
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Response objective Facebook:</u> By April 7, 2025 we aim to grow our Instagram page to at least 50 followers with a 0.90% click-through rate to our website.</p>
			    
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Response objective website:</u> By April 7, 2025 we aim to have 32 website views which were leveraged through our Instagram and Facebook page, based on 1800 views and a CTR of 0.90%.</p>
			   
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Outcome response objective website: Eventually, we ended up having 200 website views (based on Google Analytics) and 18 active users within the last week of our campaign.</p>
			
	            <p class="text-white questrial-regular">On this screenshot from Google Analytics underneath you can see that on April 6th 2025 our landing page had 200 views.</p>
			   
	      <img src="images/corporate/websiteviews.png" class="img-fluid" width="900" alt="Google Analytics">
			
			
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">With the amount of views and the amount of website views, we can calculate if our CTR is above or below the average of 0.90%.</p>
			
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">With a total of 2742 views and 200 website views we can calculate the CTR. By dividing the website views by the amount of views of our social pages and then this answer times ten gives us a CTR of 7.3%. Since this is a pretty high number compared to the average of 0.90%, it may not be an objective and accurate calculation since the amount of views are used for this. As we often check the website and the social media feeds, the chances are high that the most amount of views are coming from us and not actual interested people from our target audience.</p>
			     
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Affect objective:</u> "Booze 'N' Bands aims to ignite passion and nostalgia in hard rock fans, making them feel connected, understood, and energized by a shared love of rock and roll. Through engaging content, we create a sense of belonging, excitement, and reverence for rock history, positioning our space as the ultimate haven for rock enthusiasts." We want Booze 'N' Bands to become a go-to place for hard rock fans by encouraging conversations and community engagement.</p>

		   <p class="text-white mt-2 questrial-regular"><strong>How does the campaign link to the objectives established in the Communication and Media Plan?</strong></p>
			 <p class="text-white questrial-regular"> Our campaign directly supports the objectives outlined in our Communication and Media Plan by adapting our content and strategy to the habits of our 25–55 hard rock fan demographic. To build awareness and reach our goal of 1,800 impressions across Instagram and Facebook, we posted three times a week (with four posts in week two) at 19:00, the time our audience is most active. We used content formats like Reels, Stories, carousels, and posts to align with platform algorithms and audience preferences. On Facebook, we mainly targeted the 35–55 age group by joining and engaging in rock-related groups. On both platforms we focused on short-form video and interactive stories to encourage engagement and to also appeal to the 25-35 demographic of our audience. Initially, based on our research, we expected the dual-platform approach to be essential to have a successful campaign, however after this campaign ended we noticed that Facebook did not have the desired results at all. Emotionally, we created content with the purpose to foster a sense of nostalgia, and belonging through rock legend tributes, bar atmosphere highlights, and user participation in event planning, directly addressing our affect objective. Finally, with consistent branding and strategic calls to action, we aimed for a 0.90% CTR, translating impressions into website visits.</p>

			<h4 id="informationtargetaudience" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Justifications of Target Audience</h4>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">
				<strong class="text-white questrial-regular">Understanding Our Target Audience: Hard Rock Fans Aged 25-35 and 35-55</strong><br>
				<br>

				Hard rock fans come from diverse backgrounds, but they share a deep emotional and energetic connection to the music. Our target audience consists of two primary groups: younger fans (25-35) who embrace modern and innovative sounds, and older fans (35-55) who have a strong attachment to classic hard rock. All information without sources is based on our interviews.<br>
				<br>

				<strong>Younger Hard Rock Fans (25-35)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Many hard rock fans discover the genre in their teens or early 20s, often through platforms like Spotify and YouTube, where they are drawn to the genre's high energy, instrument-heavy compositions, the fusion of traditional hard rock with more contemporary sounds and lyrics connected to the real world, such as an album called “American Idiot” by Green Day. These fans actively seek out new music through playlists, social media, especially on TikTok and Instagram, and word-of-mouth recommendations. They also enjoy attending live concerts and festivals, preferring immersive experiences that allow them to connect with both the music and the community. While hard rock is a strong music preference, it doesn’t define their entire lifestyle, and they value authenticity in branding, though they tend to shy away from traditional hard rock fashion. What they want most is greater visibility for modern hard rock, exclusive events, and online content align with both age groups. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Older Hard Rock Fans (35-55)</strong><br>
				<br>
				Lifelong hard rock fans, many of whom grew up during the genre's peak in the '70s and '80s, are deeply connected to legendary bands like Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and AC/DC. They are drawn to the nostalgic, high-energy elements of hard rock, with a particular fondness for ballads and orchestral rock styles alongside the heavier sounds. Their music discovery largely comes from radio, YouTube, Facebook and word-of-mouth, preferring long-form content such as album reviews and band interviews over quick, bite-sized media. While they still value live concerts, they attend fewer shows, often enjoying cover bands and classic rock nights. Hard rock has long been a passion rather than an active lifestyle, and while traditional rock fashion doesn’t appeal to them, they appreciate quality band merchandise and memorabilia, they often enjoy CDs and vinyl records. They seek a balance between classic nostalgia and fresh innovation, remaining open to new bands, though finding them can be a challenge. Engaging musical experiences, in-depth examinations of rock's development and exclusive events may reignite interest in the genre. <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Key Takeaways for Positioning </strong><br>
				<br>
				To appeal to both younger and older hard rock fans, the bar should feature a mix of classic anthems and newer rock selections. The atmosphere should balance hard rock's rebellious energy with modern aesthetics, avoiding clichés. Live events are essential, as both demographics value them; Classic Rock Nights with tribute acts for older fans, and Modern Rock Showcases for younger audiences, along with exclusive experiences like meetups and jam sessions. Digital connection through platforms like Instagram and Facebook should complement physical gatherings and experiences. Maintaining authenticity is essential—the establishment needs to embody genuine rock spirit rather than appearing overly polished or commercialized. <br>
				<br>
				
				<strong>Why Such a Wide Target Audience?</strong> <br>
				<br>
				The rapid technological and cultural changes in modern society have created unprecedented disconnection between generations. Rapid technological advancements and increased societal mobility have led to significant differences in communication and lifestyle. Younger generations adopt diverse values and modern lifestyles, diverging from traditional norms. With longer life expectancies and accelerating societal change, more generations coexist with distinct experiences and perspectives. Evolving cultural norms, such as increased individualism, further widen the gap between younger and older generations, creating a divide that is arguably larger than at any point in history (Study Finds Widening Generation Gap, 2009) <br>
				<br>

				Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody. By engaging in music together, particularly hard rock, generations can overcome age-related barriers and deepen their connections  (The Power of Music in Connecting Generations, n.d.). <br>
				<br>
				
				The genre's ability to span generations is evident in its continued popularity. Iconic bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath continue to attract new, younger fans while maintaining their original audience. This multi-generational appeal allows people of different ages to bond over shared musical interests, fostering understanding and connection across generational divides. The enduring appeal of classic rock bands creates a unique opportunity for different age groups to find common ground, share experiences, and appreciate each other's musical tastes (Schobel, 2024).  <br>
				<br>

				<strong>Booze ‘n Bands in Utrecht</strong><br>
				<br>
				Utrecht is the perfect location for Booze N Bands, offering a central position in the Netherlands that makes it easily accessible for both local patrons and touring bands. The city's proximity to the renowned Herman Brood Academie, which nurtures emerging musical talent, allows for potential collaborations and performances from up-and-coming rock bands. Utrecht also boasts an established rock culture, with venues like Club Café Stairway to Heaven and an active metal community, yet there is an opportunity for a bar that blends classic and modern hard rock styles, setting us apart and offering a one-of-a-kind experience. The city's growing tourism and vibrant cultural scene attract diverse crowds, providing an ideal setting to appeal to our target audience of hard rock fans aged 25-35 and 35-55. Younger fans, who gravitate toward new, innovative rock sounds, and older fans, who cherish the genre's classic anthems, will both find a space to connect, making Utrecht an ideal hub for bridging generational gaps and creating a unique, intergenerational music experience. Music serves as a powerful connector between generations. According to Percussion Play, intergenerational music activities strengthen bonds, encourage communication, and bridge generational gaps. This shared experience fosters understanding across age groups, allowing different generations to connect through rhythm and melody. By engaging in music together, particularly hard rock, generations can overcome age-related barriers and deepen their connections (The Power of Music in Connecting Generations, n.d.). <br>

		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Demographics:</u></p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Based on research by Taylor (2024), rock is the favourite musical style of the ages 16 to 29, 30 to 49 and 50 to 64. Based on research and out interviews it's clear that rock is an ageless music genre, appreciated by many and all. Therefore, we decided to target people ages 25-35 and 35-55 to maximize our efforts.</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Gender within hard rock is predominantly male, but female hard rock fans are a growing segment, especially among younger listeners. Rock music has long been viewed as a genre largely shaped by male perspectives, with lyrics frequently centered on sex and drugs, potentially making it less relatable to women (John, 2023).</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Income Level is usually middle to upper-middle income, as hard rock fans often invest in concert tickets, merchandise, vinyl records, and premium streaming subscriptions (Irwin, 2022).</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Education Level ranges from high school graduates to university-educated professionals.</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Geographics:</u></p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">In the Netherlands since 2010 there have been 4 545 hard rock concerts (Calendar. n.d.).</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">As evidenced by events like the iconic "Monsters of Rock" festival in Tilburg, which drew 30,000 fans in 1988, Netherlands has many had rock fans. Additionally, the Netherlands is home to numerous hard rock and metal festivals, such as Dynamo Metal Fest and Into the Grave, which attract thousands of attendees annually (Geerts, J. 2024).</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">There are some rock themed bars in the Netherlands such as: Hard Rock Café in Amsterdam, Rockcafé Backstage in Nijmegen, Rockcafé taste in Groenlo however the offer that exist currently is relatively small. The US has 31 Hard Rock Cafés, whereas the Netherlands has just one in Amsterdam (Hard Rock Café, n.d.). This is only a comparison of the amount of Hard Rock Cafés and not even of the other rock-themed bars in the US. This indicates that the offer for such bars is small in the Netherlands.</p>
			    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">A lot of interviewees mentioned that they either know or like the Hard Rock Café brand and that they miss more bars like that in the Netherlands. This makes the Netherlands the ultimate place to locate the Booze ‘N’ Bands bar, as the competition is rather small and our interviewees showed a high-demand for a rock-themed bar.</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Psychographic:</u></p>
			   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">According to our interviews, their values are authenticity, freedom, rebellion, and individuality. They often admire the raw expression of emotions and the anti-establishment lyrics. The lifestyle of many fans is attending live shows and music festivals. Based on our interviews we realized most people’s motivations are that they are seeking a sense of belonging and emotional release and it connects a lot with nostalgia. A lot of interviewees stated that they like listening to hard rock as it gives them a positive energetic feeling, this really helps them for example with finishing a hard task. Most people enjoy sharing their music experiences with others, but not necessarily for the purpose of belonging to a community.</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Behavioural</u></p>
			   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Music Consumption Habits:</p>
		         <ul class="text-white questrial-regular">
	                <li>Our interviews have said that streaming platforms like Spotify are used for listening to music and checking their recommendations, and YouTube for daily listening likewise.</li>
	                <li>They purchase vinyl records and CDs to support their favourite artists, however not all of them, which makes up 10% of the primary modes of music consumption (Wallach, 2023). </li>
	                <li>They are active participants in concert culture such as attending gigs, festivals, and live shows. Either a few times a year or a month.  </li>
	                <li>Our interviewees have said that they discover music through Spotify recommendations and word-of-mouth.</li>
		         </ul>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Digital Platforms Usage:</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><i>Social Media:</i> Primarily active on Instagram (for band updates and behind-the-scenes content); the largest age group on Instagram is 25-34, making up 31.7% of all users (Revankar, 2025), Facebook (for event groups and rock fan communities); Facebook had approximately 2.989 billion monthly active users (DataReportal, n.d.), with a diverse user base, with 18-55+ year-olds active on the platform, each age group engaging differently—young users (18-24) stay connected but prefer other platforms, while older demographics (25-55+) use Facebook for career, lifestyle, news, and community engagement (Stroud, 2024), and YouTube for the music videos and for band content. Other platforms that were mentioned were TikTok and Reddit, however they were not as often mentioned as Facebook and Instagram. Therefore, our focus will be on Instagram and Facebook.</p>  
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">We've noticed that for people 20-35 they prefer short content, and behind the scenes videos whereas people ages 35-55 like longer videos such as interviews. </p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Most of our interviewees have said they spend time on social media either in the morning or in the evening after work.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><i>Purchasing Behaviour:</i> many interviews have mentioned that they don’t buy merchandise specifically or engage in other fashion or hard rock-related activities, except for purchasing concert tickets and the CD or vinyl lovers.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><i>Event Attendance:</i> regular attendees of concerts and festivals, our interviewees have mentioned typically a few times a year or every few months. </p>  
			
			
	
			
		 <p id="marketing-2" class="text-white mt-4 questrial-regular">Channels and Platforms</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">As explained above, to promote our brand effectively, we  used Instagram and Facebook. This decision was based on both desk research as our interviews. We noticed that during our interviews the most mentioned platforms were Instagram and Facebook. Desk research also showed that within our demographic Facebook and Instagram are in general the most used platforms. In conclusion we chose Facebook and Instagram as they align with the demographics of our target audiences and offer the right content formats for engagement.</p>

          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights about audience growth patterns. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. This helps us set more realistic benchmarks for the future. Moving forward, we'll leverage this understanding to create more impactful content and engagement approaches that acknowledge the evolving nature of audience building.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Learning Week 1:</u></p>
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">In the first week, we prioritized rapid exposure by immediately sharing our Instagram account with friends, family, and by actively engaging with the hard rock fan community. This direct approach sparked a notable initial growth in followers and visibility. However, the performance analytics of our first reel—despite being nearly a minute long—revealed an average view time of only 11 seconds. This was a clear indicator that our video content strategy needed refinement. Based on these insights, we adjusted our approach by producing shorter, more dynamic reels designed to grab attention instantly and sustain viewer interest. Although the early reel results were not as strong as expected, we successfully achieved our week one objectives. This was largely driven by the intrigue and anticipation we generated—the tension of the unknown worked in our favor, sparking curiosity and engagement.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">In Week 2, our strategy shifted from intrigue to credibility, focusing on involving our audience more directly. We revealed the physical location of our bar and shared a sign logo mockup, bringing our vision to life and building anticipation.</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">We then posted our house rules in a carousel to set expectations, emphasizing that Booze 'n' Bands is an adult-only bar. This helped reinforce our brand identity and align with our audience on the kind of environment we’re creating. </p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">To maintain engagement, we asked followers which artists or bands they'd like to see at our venue using the "write something" sticker in a story. However, engagement was higher when we used a poll in Week 1. This suggests that while followers want to have input, they prefer less effort on their part, indicating that simpler engagement formats work best. </p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Despite slightly lower reach compared to Week 1, we still saw quality engagement, including saves and comments. Week 2 helped solidify our brand identity, and we learned the importance of balancing audience participation with ease of engagement.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">We posted a short 19-second video explaining how followers could win free beer on our opening night. Drawing from our Week 1 insight, that our audience has a short attention span, we intentionally kept the video brief and to the point, aiming to boost retention and encourage interaction.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">We shared another interactive story, this time using a poll format to let followers guess the lyrics of a well-known rock song. Based on insights from Week 2, we returned to using polls, as they had previously shown higher engagement than open-ended stickers. This quick and low-effort interaction proved more effective once again.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">This marked a clear improvement over the open-ended engagement format used in Week 2, reinforcing that our audience prefers simple, tap-based interactions that require minimal effort.</p>
			
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Learning Week 3:</u></p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">In Week 3, our marketing strategy focused on creating excitement through engaging content, including the grand opening announcement, a giveaway, and interactive stories. Unfortunately, the results didn’t align with our expectations. While our follower counts increased, engagement metrics such as likes and interactions remained consistent with Week 1. This showed that our assumption that engagement would rise alongside our growing follower base was incorrect.</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">After analyzing the performance of our Week 1 reel (56 seconds long), which had an average watch time of 11 seconds, we decided to shorten our Week 3 reel to 19 seconds. Despite the average watch time remaining at 6 seconds for the Week 3 reel, we recognize that viewers are actually consuming a larger percentage of the content. In Week 1, viewers watched only about 20% of the reel, whereas in Week 3, they watched approximately 31% of the reel. This suggests that while total watch time may not have increased, viewers are engaging with a more significant portion of the video. On top of all of this we also did not meet our set objectives.</p>

To encourage more interaction, we also promised that one of the people who comments will eventually get invited to perform at our bar.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Learning Week 4:</u></p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">The key takeaway from Week 4 is that while we are making strides in promoting our brand’s various aspects, we need to better understand what truly drives engagement with our audience. It’s important to fine-tune our approach, focusing on creating content that offers more immediate value and deeper connections with our followers. Moving forward, we will experiment with different formats and calls to action to see what best sparks interest and interaction.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Summary of Learnings Instagram</strong></p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">At the start, we focused on creating longer-form reels to introduce our brand. However, we quickly learned from the performance of our first reel—where the average watch time was just 11 seconds on a 1-minute video—that our audience had a short attention span. In response, we shortened the length of our reels, making them more dynamic and immediate, aligning with the preferences of our followers. While the results were still mixed, this tactical change was essential in improving engagement.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Initially, we experienced high engagement levels, especially when using interactive formats like polls and quizzes. For instance, the poll on 14/03 (“Guess our product?”) and the interactive poll on 28/03 (“Guess the lyrics”) proved successful, with the latter showing significantly higher engagement than similar posts from Week 2. These insights emphasized that our audience thrives on low-effort interactions such as tapping on a poll, rather than open-ended responses or more complex story formats.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">However, as we progressed, the overall engagement began to decline, with later posts like our "Grand Opening" announcement (24/03) and the "Food and Drinks Menu" post (23/03) seeing lower interaction rates. This decline is understandable as the novelty of early posts began to wear off, and followers started to lose interest, or perhaps their attention was divided.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">While we initially experienced rapid follower growth by sharing our Instagram account with friends and family and actively engaging with the hard rock fan community, we noticed that follower growth slowed down after the first few weeks. This shift in follower acquisition is a common pattern in social media growth, where an initial surge is followed by a more gradual and organic increase. As we approach a more established community, we now understand that growth will likely continue at a more measured pace, and our benchmarks need to be adjusted accordingly. Going forward, we will need to prioritize quality over quantity in follower acquisition.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Another challenge that emerged as we continued posting was the appearance of our feed. Over time, with multiple posts on different days, the aesthetic cohesion of the feed started to suffer. The content became slightly disjointed, with posts ranging from logos to rules to behind-the-scenes sneak peeks. While this content was valuable, it made the feed feel cluttered and lacked a consistent visual flow. </p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">To improve this, we could consider a more structured content calendar that integrates cohesive visuals and more balanced post formats. Planning for consistent themes or colors, as well as spacing out post types (e.g., reels, static images, carousels), could help maintain a cleaner, more attractive feed.</p>
			  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Lastly, in real life, if we were actually promoting a physical bar and not just promising it, we could have marketed with real images that captured the authentic vibe of the space less polished and more relatable, showcasing the true atmosphere we intend to create. This approach would have allowed us to present a more realistic and grounded experience for our followers. Additionally, we could have targeted our marketing efforts more specifically to a local audience in Utrecht, collaborating with nearby clubs, bars, and cafes to build a stronger community presence and increase word-of-mouth promotion. The inability to promote something tangible or real, such as the actual bar space, added a layer of challenge to our strategy, as we were working with abstract concepts and visuals, rather than a concrete product. This limitation affected how effectively we could connect with our audience on a deeper, more immediate level.</p>
			
		 <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Summary of Learnings Facebook:</strong></p>	
		   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Since our Facebook page was not as successful, our statistics also did not show great differences each week, like our Instagram statistics did. Therefore, we have chosen to write a general summary of our learning of our Facebook page instead of doing it week by week.</p>
			 
		   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Looking back on our Facebook marketing efforts, it's clear that the objectives we initially set were overly ambitious, especially considering the results we achieved. In Week 1, we gained just 2 Facebook followers and reached only 12 hard rock fans. This low level of engagement was a stark contrast to our expectations. As we moved into Week 3, our reach had increased to 72 hard rock fans, which seemed like a positive shift, but it still felt underwhelming given the scope of our promotional efforts.</p>
			 
		   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Our response objective was to have 5 followers by the end of Week 3, which we did achieve, but this was still a relatively modest increase. Comparing these results to Instagram metrics, where we saw higher engagement, it was clear that Facebook was not providing the same level of traction. This slow growth in followers and engagement highlighted that our Facebook strategy needed to be adjusted. The switch to approaching Facebook groups in the middle of the campaign didn’t significantly boost our results, and we quickly realized that Facebook’s performance lagged behind our other platforms, particularly Instagram.</p>
			
		   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Given these insights, we’ve decided to shift our focus for future campaigns. Instead of relying heavily on Facebook’s social media marketing approach, we will reconsider how we target our older demographic. We’re now leaning toward a more word-of-mouth approach, where real-world interactions and referrals could play a bigger role. By stepping away from Facebook’s social media-centric marketing strategies, we hope to engage with our audience in a more authentic, localized way that better aligns with the behavior and preferences of our target demographic. This strategic pivot will help us move away from platforms that may not yield the results we hope for and focus on methods that are likely to drive more meaningful connections and engagement.</p>
			
         <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Based on what we have learned through this already, we will recalculate our objectives.
		  Looking at the initial campaign data, we can observe several key insights:</p>
		  
		  <ol>
			    <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Instagram significantly outperformed Facebook across all metrics (reach, views, engagement)</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Interactive content had moderate engagement but could be optimized</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Facebook reach remained consistently low throughout the campaign</li>
			    <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Our reels were still too long, even after adapting the duration of them, which does not keep the attention of our audience</li>
		  </ol>
			
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Future Recommendations:</p>
		  <ol class="text-white questrial-regular">
			  <li>Platform Strategy Refinement: Primary Focus on Instagram, given the significantly higher engagement rates, allocate 70% of resources to Instagram and 30% to Facebook. It might even be an option to only continue the promotional efforts in Instagram.</li>
			  <li>Content Optimization: Video-First Approach, Increase video content from 25% to 50% of all posts, emphasizing authentic behind-the-scenes footage. User-Generated Content Initiative, use more creative hashtags because we use the same hastags in every post. We could partner with featured bands to co-create content before and after performances.</li>
			  <li>Based on the average viewing time of our audience, Reels should not be longer than 10 seconds.</li>
			  <li>Measurement and Analytics: Refined KPIs: Set more realistic growth targets based on logarithmic growth patterns. A/B Testing Schedule: Systematically test different posting times to optimize engagement. Conversion Tracking: Implement mechanisms to track social media influence on actual bar attendance</li>
			  <li>Visual Identity Consistency: Our current posts sometimes lack a cohesive visual language, when you look at the feed. We should develop a clear set of visual guidelines including consistent color filters, typography treatments, and branded elements that make our content immediately recognizable even without seeing our logo.</li>
			</ol>
	
	  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Future objectives:</strong></p>
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Objective 1: Maximize reach on Instagram: Make Instagram the primary channel by optimizing posting schedules and using rich, diverse content formats.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Optimize Frequency: Increase posting frequency to 2–4 times per week with a mix of high-quality images, reels, stories and videos.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Peak Timing: Identify and target peak engagement hours for posts, using historical data to fine-tune scheduling.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Collaborations: Partner with influencers or micro-influencers to further expand reach and tap into new audience segments.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Metrics: Monitor follower growth, overall impressions, and post reach on a weekly basis to adjust the strategy as needed.</li>	
		</ul>
          
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Objective 2: Enhance content effectiveness through video-centric storytelling: Strengthen the brand message by prioritizing engaging, high-quality video content that connects emotionally with the audience.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Content Creation: Develop a series of engaging videos (such as product demos, behind-the-scenes looks, and customer testimonials) that align with the brand’s core values.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Video Optimization: Experiment with various video formats and styles while maintaining a minimum of two dedicated video posts per week.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Storytelling Approach: Ensure each video delivers a clear narrative and a compelling call to action, making the content both memorable and sharable.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Metrics: Track engagement metrics such as video views, watch time, share rates, and audience retention to assess the effectiveness of content.</li>	
		</ul>
			
	   <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Objective 3: Boost audience response through interactive and action-oriented Content: Drive audience engagement by incorporating interactive elements and clear call-to-actions across posts, particularly on Instagram.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Clear CTAs: Integrate direct, compelling CTAs in posts and videos that prompt immediate action, whether it’s visiting a website link, sharing content, or commenting.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Interactive Features: Use Instagram stories and posts to launch interactive elements like polls, Q and As, and contests that encourage participation.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">UGC Promotion: Encourage and showcase user-generated content to foster a sense of community and trust, making customers feel an active part of the brand story.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Metrics: Measure success by tracking likes, comments, direct messages, click-through rates, and conversion data to understand audience responsiveness.</li>	
		</ul>
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">To conclude, through our social media journey, we've gained valuable insights. Initially, we anticipated steady, linear follower growth based on our early momentum. What we discovered instead was a natural curve where rapid initial growth gradually transitions to a more measured pace. We've also learned that our reels are too long, which fails to maintain audience attention, and that interactive content has potential but needs optimization to fully engage our target audience. Facebook's consistently low reach across all content types indicates we should recalibrate our platform strategy to prioritize where our audience is most responsive.</p>

		  <p class="text-white"> <strong>Justifications of Our Social Media Posts</strong></p>
	  <p class="text-white">The Booze 'N’ Bands Instagram and Facebook feed reflects the gritty, high-energy vibe of a live music bar. The use of vibrant colors and handwritten typography captures the raw, rebellious spirit of the music while also setting us apart from the crowd. Mixing band photos, bar interiors, and graphic posters gives followers a full sense of the experience and what they can expect at the bar (music, drinks, food, and atmosphere). The posters serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, promoting events while reinforcing brand identity. Repeating the logo and using a consistent color palette creates visual cohesion across the feed. One thing we could improve is the overall layout, as some posts currently feel visually heavier than others, which slightly disrupts the balance of the grid. However, hard rock fans don’t like feeling like they’re being marketed to, and the feed’s spontaneous, unpolished energy helps us stand out. It's a visual experience designed to connect with our audience and leave a lasting impression. Underneath is a screenshot of our social media feed.</p>
		 
			
		<img src="images/corporate/socialmediafeed.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Social Media Feed">
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">With these social media posts, we wanted to convey the following feelings within our audience. We deliver an authentic experience that captures the genuine essence of hard rock culture, immersing fans in its raw, unapologetic spirit. We want our audience to feel respected and acknowledged as enthusiasts rather than casual listeners. We want them to feel that we understand and share their passion. Through powerful, high-energy content, we aimed to keep fans energized and inspired, staying true to the intensity that defines hard rock. Ultimately we want our audience to trust our brand and that they feel confident towards our brand, we aimed to do this by creating quality content with attention to detail. There is one point of improvement, although all the content has a grainy effect and uses the same font, in the end of the campaign we noticed that our feed does not look as cohesive as we thought it would.</p>

			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Before starting with our problem interviews, we first brainstormed about problems that we assume hard rock fans have. With the problem interviews we could see whether our assumed problems were valid or if there was a more prominent problem that we needed to focus on. Underneath is a list of the assumed problems before starting with our interviews.</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">The hard rock genre is not as prominent anymore.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Lack of community.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">No innovation, no new bands arise.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">It's hard for new hard rock bands to get venues since it's not a prominent genre that people book venues for.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">What would make hard rock more appealing to younger generations today? </li>
			
		</ul>
			
	    <p class="text-white questrial-regular">After conducting the problem interviews, we noticed that not all our assumed problems were valid. For example, hard rock is still very prominent not only within the older demographic, but also within the younger demographic. This showed us that hard rock is already very appealing to younger generations. It just does not get as much media attention as it used to get. Secondly, we thought that there was not a lot of innovation within the genre, but after the interviews we found out that there is innovation, but that a lot of people just do not know a lot about new bands or artists. They often do not know where to look for them. The fact that it is hard for new bands to get venues seemed to be a valid assumption, this again indicates that it is hard for hard rock fans to learn about new artists as they do not get booked a lot. Our most surprising finding was the fact that hard rock fans are not looking to be a part of a community at all. They like to talk with others about hard rock and share music with each other, but they do not want to be part of a community and they also do not feel like they are part of one.</p>
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Another thing that we noticed was that a lot of hard rock fans mentioned that they like the hard rock café or that they would like to have a hard rock themed bar. They are very interested into live performances and would love to have some more cheaper options to listen to live hard rock. This is eventually how we came up with the Booze 'N' Bands bar and we started creating our first paper prototype of the lean canvas.</p>
			
	<h4 id="management-2" class="mt-4 text-white questrial-regular">Lean Canvas</h4>
			
			
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">First Version Paper:</p> <img src="images/corporate/paperleancanvas.png" class ="img-fluid" width="752" height="530" alt="Paper Lean Canvas">
	
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Our assumed problems after conducting the interviews and creating this prototype was competition, with the Hard Rock Cafe being a big franchise, we were worried that our target audience would not be that interested in our bar. However, after thinking through our idea, we realized that we have a unique value and that being that we are genre-specific with an inclination to give upcoming bands a chance at shining. In comparison to Hard Rock Cafe, they have become more widespread, not so confused on hard rock but playing more wide stream music.</p>
			
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">However, another concern we had was our bar would be focused strictly on hard rock and emerging bands, it might be too narrow. We feared our concept wouldn’t attract enough interest from a broader audience used to mainstream music. On the other side, we really did a lot of research of this, and we thought it would be a good idea to stick to this. Many interviewees shared that they were tired of the generic, wide-stream approach in established venues. They craved a more authentic and dedicated hard rock experience that celebrated the true spirit of the genre.</p>
			
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">This initial idea connected a lot with the findings that we received in our problem interviews which were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Authenticity: Interviewees expressed a strong desire for a venue that feels genuine and connected to the hard rock culture. They expressed that many places do not have the type of new music they are looking for.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Exclusive Platform for New Talent: A recurring theme in our interviews was the enthusiasm for supporting emerging bands. Many respondents noted that they’d love to frequent a venue that not only entertains but also serves as a place for local talent. This insight reinforced our decision to focus on giving upcoming bands the spotlight.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Social Connection and Nostalgia: Many interviewees expressed a longing for the authentic, communal vibe reminiscent of classic rock eras.

          <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Problem</p>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">Our research and interviews indicate that the hard rock genre has significantly declined in mainstream prominence compared to previous decades. This diminished visibility negatively affects both fans and aspiring musicians. Specifically, emerging hard rock bands face difficulties in securing venues to showcase their talent, as venues are hesitant to book lesser-known or new artists. Consequently, the pipeline for new talent within the genre has stagnated, hindering the overall growth and vitality of hard rock music. Existing hard rock concerts, festivals, and events have become increasingly expensive, limiting accessibility for dedicated fans and further isolating the community from engaging fully with the music they love.</p>
		  
          <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">An intimate, genre-specific bar dedicated exclusively to hard rock, creating a community-driven space for passionate fans to connect.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Regular live performances offering aspiring artists an exclusive stage to showcase their music.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Offering an authentic and immersive atmosphere aligned closely with the brand identity of celebrating and revitalizing the hard rock culture, distinguishing it from generic music venues.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Age:  Predominantly between 25 to 55 years old, with a core male audience. However, recent trends show an increase in younger female fans actively engaging with hard rock.</li>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Location: Primarily Utrecht-based, reflecting the local demand identified in our interviews. Dutch fans clearly indicated a desire for more dedicated hard rock venues within the Netherlands.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Lifestyle: Passionate individuals who deeply value authenticity, personal expression, rebellion against norms, and genuine emotional connections. They actively participate in the live music scene, prioritizing experiences that reflect their identity.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Behaviour: Social media savvy, frequently using Instagram and Facebook to stay updated on events, bands, and new music releases. They commonly discover new music through Spotify's algorithmic recommendations and rely on word-of-mouth within their community.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Purchasing Habits: Regularly attend concerts and music events, investing primarily in tickets and physical music formats such as CDs and vinyl. They typically do not prioritize fashion merchandise, preferring purchases directly supporting their favourite artists’ music and performances. </li>

		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Unique value proposition</p>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">A one-of-a-kind hard rock bar providing an authentic space for like-minded hard rock fans to connect in the modern world, offering an exclusive stage for upcoming bands and delivering the energy of live concerts without the high costs of major festivals.</p>
         
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>

			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Loyal and passionate customers.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Exclusive relationships with emerging hard rock bands.</li>
          </ul>
         
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Channels</p>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><u>Social Media:</u> Using Instagram to visually showcase event highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, artist interactions, and engaging short-form content to attract younger fans. Facebook is employed for detailed event announcements, fostering online communities through groups, driving discussions, and connecting more deeply with our slightly older audience segment. Both platforms are key for fan interaction, building excitement, and maintaining regular communication with our audience.</p>
          
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Number of live shows per month.</li>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Attendance rates per event.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Bar revenue per event.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Merchandise sales volume.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Social media engagement.</li>

          </ul>
          
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Our revenue streams will primarily include drink sales generated through our bar offerings, ensuring steady income during events and regular business hours.</li>
			 <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Additional income will come from merchandise sales, sourced directly from the performing bands, allowing fans to support artists and providing a supplementary revenue channel.</li>
			  <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Finally, occasional ticket sales for exclusive, high-profile guest performances.</li>
          </ul>
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Estimated revenue for the first full year of operation:</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">With the bar operating three days per week (Thursday to Saturday), there will be a total of 156 operating days annually. Assuming an average of 200 drinks sold per night at €5.50 each, projected drink sales would generate approximately €171,600 over the first full year (200 drinks × €5.50 × 156 days). This is consistent with average bar profitability when optimized for limited hours and targeted clientele (BinWise, n.d. -a; IBISWorld, 2024).</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">In addition to drink sales, the bar’s role as a venue for live hard rock performances enables supplemental income through occassional ticket sales, band cover charges, and merchandise. Estimating an average of €450 per night from these sources results in an additional €70,200 annually. Altogether, the projected first-year revenue totals approximately €241,800. This hybrid model, combining regular beverage sales with occasional event-driven income, mirrors successful strategies used by niche bars to create high-impact experiences on fewer nights (IBISWorld, 2024).</p>

		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Cost structure</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Fixed Costs: Venue rental and maintenance, Staff salaries, Licensing and permits, Equipment maintenance. </li>
            <li class="text-white questrial-regular">Variable Costs: Artist fees, Merchandise production, Drink supplies, Marketing and promotion, Event-specific logistics.</li>
			<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Occasional Costs: Special guest accommodations, Event decor and stage design.</li>
          </ol>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold text-white questrial-regular">Cost structure and cost per unit estimate:</p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Startup costs are projected between €40,000 and €70,000. This includes approximately €2,160 in licensing fees, €25,000–€57,000 for renovations and sound equipment, and about €10,000 for initial inventory. These estimates align with real-world experiences of bar entrepreneurs in the Netherlands and available business startup data (Business.gov.nl, n.d.).</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Annual operating costs for the 3-day-per-week model are estimated at around €163,000. Fixed expenses include €24,000 for rent and €12,000 for utilities. Staff wages are budgeted at €60,000, reflecting fewer weekly shifts. Inventory (drinks and supplies) is projected at €48,000, and marketing/event promotion remains at €10,000 to maintain strong visibility in the local nightlife scene (IBISWorld, 2024).</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">The per-unit cost of each drink is about €3.00, which includes both direct inputs (like alcohol, mixers, and disposables) and a share of overhead expenses (BinWise, n.d.-b). With a selling price of €5.50, this gives a gross profit of €2.50 per drink. Over 156 nights, with 200 drinks sold each night, drink sales alone would yield a gross profit of €78,000. Adding event-related revenue and subtracting operational costs, the net profit for the first full year is estimated at €78,800, showcasing a lean but profitable approach suited to music-oriented bars with niche appeal (IBISWorld, 2024).</p>

The combination of these elements creates our unique value proposition of "a one-of-a-kind hard rock bar providing an authentic space for like-minded hard rock fans to connect in the modern world."</p>

          <h4 id="management-3" class="mt-2 text-white questrial-regular">Validation of assumptions/the process of creating the brand and bar</h4>
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular">We first conducted a brainstorming session to create our brand name, during which we quickly recognized that our initial ideas were too stereotypical and did not accurately represent the authentic spirit of hard rock. Early suggestions such as "Stairway Suites," "Highway to Rest," "Bohemian Haven," and "The Rolling Stays" drew too heavily from famous rock bands, reinforcing clichés rather than originality. <br>
	      <br>  
		  To improve our approach, we began conducting research on search engines into the essential qualities of hard rock music to help guide our naming process. Despite this, many subsequent ideas, like "The Blackout," "Inferno Suites," "The Shadow Chord," "Grindstone Rock," "The Phantom Riff," "The Backstage," and "The SoundStay," still felt overly predictable or niche-specific, highlighting our limited experience with the genre. <br>
		  <br>
          Seeking external input, we reached out on Reddit for perspectives from dedicated hard rock fans. While these insights were informative about our audience needs, they did not directly yield usable name ideas. However, a spontaneous interaction within our group, inspired by a playful name of our WhatsApp chat "Rock 'n Roll Baby," sparked interest in using " 'n' " between two key thematic words. <br>
		  <br>
          After numerous attempts, Ariana suggested "Booze" to reflect the bar and music event concept we envisioned, and Lara then added "Bands" to signify the music element. Initially, "Booze 'N' Bands" received mixed reactions, but upon further reflection and after repeated use, the name resonated and was ultimately chosen. <br>
          <br>
          Regarding our trademark design, we created a mood board focusing on a rugged aesthetic with either a hand-brushed or spray-painted font style. This mood board also contained more brighter colours instead of the cliché combination of red, orange and black. Initially we thought that it was necessary to use these stereotypical colours, however after conducting our problem interviews we noticed that we had to pivot this idea. We went in another direction and started creating a brand identity that: uses the expected color palette (black, red) but with modern application, focuses on musical elements rather than lifestyle stereotypes and embraces energy and rebellion without the negative connotations. This is how we created the first version of our moodboard below.<br>
			  <br>
		     <img src="images/corporate/moodboard.png" class ="img-fluid" width="760" height="360" alt="Mood Board"><br>
			  <br>
			      Although we explored available fonts in Adobe Illustrator, none captured our intended visual identity. Consequently, Nicole, who has expertise in Adobe Illustrator, created a custom hand-drawn font that perfectly aligned with our original vision: a rough, authentic style with each word positioned on separate lines. <br>

			  <img src="images/corporate/font2.png" class ="img-fluid" width="400" height="380" alt="Font Two"> <br>
			  <br>
			      Additionally, we experimented with creative touches such as incorporating lightning imagery or stylizing the "Z" in "Booze," but ultimately decided to maintain uniformity and consistency in colour and style throughout the design. <br>

		  <h4 id="management-4" class="mt-2 text-white questrial-regular">Pivots</h4>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Underneath is a list of ideas that we had before, but were pivoted/adapted after the problem interviews.</p>
			
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Original Assumption: Hard rock branding requires stereotypical imagery:</strong></p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Pivot: Create a brand identity that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Uses the expected color palette (black, red) but with modern application, the use of brighter colours.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Focuses on musical elements rather than lifestyle stereotypes.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Embraces energy and rebellion without the negative connotations.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Original Assumption: Hard rock fans are not seeking for new venues to experience live music, therefore we wanted to create an Airbnb that was hard rock themed:</strong></p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Pivot: A bar is more suitable to our target audience:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Many hard rock fans expressed their love for listening to live music.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Hard rock fans want more accessible and cheap venues to experience live music.</li>
			</ul>
			
        <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Original Assumption: Hard rock as not as prominent within the younger demographic, the service/product should appeal to the older demographic:</strong></p>
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Pivot: Hard rock is loved by both demographics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Product/service should appeal to both demopgraphics.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Both demographics expressed interest in a bar where you can listen to live hard rock music.</li>
				<li class="text-white questrial-regular">Bar should put focus on both the classics as well as new artists to appeal to both demographics.</li>
			</ul>

		 <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Summary of findings solution interviews:</strong></p>
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular">The interviews showed that most people were excited about the idea of a hard rock bar like Booze ‘N’ Bands. They felt that this kind of place is missing from the current nightlife scene. Many interviewees said they were tired of bars that mostly play pop or dance music and liked the idea of a space that focuses just on hard rock. They believed that if done well, this bar could attract a strong and loyal group of visitors who love rock music.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Most people said that the way the bar looks and feels is very important. They liked that the theme was clearly hard rock, with things like vintage decorations, guitars on the walls, neon signs, and red leather seats. These details made the bar feel more real and helped create the right vibe. The central stage was also something many people liked, especially because it helped keep the band close to the crowd. Some interviewees, felt the stage could be improved by moving it to the side or raising it a bit to make sure everyone could see. Others said the lighting was cool but also needed to be practical since people still want to see their food or read the menu.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Live music was one of the most liked parts of the concept. People said they would go to the bar just to hear live rock music. They liked the idea of being able to suggest bands to play or even come to special themed nights, like tribute shows. Participants liked the idea of letting smaller, newer bands play. They said this would give new talent a place to grow, and it would also make the bar more interesting for regular visitors.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">The menu got mixed feedback. People liked that the food and drink names were fun and related to rock music. Most people also thought the prices were fair. However, several interviewees said the food menu was hard to read because the font was small or the contrast was too low, especially in dim lighting. Others, said it was confusing that cocktails were listed under the food section. The drink selection was another point of feedback. Some participants said there should be more beer options, especially Belgian or craft beers, because the ones listed were too basic. On the food side, others said the food should be easy to share and eat while standing or walking around. The online reservations were seen as helpful and really liked, especially if they didn’t take away from the rock theme.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Many people brought up the need for good security and a safe atmosphere. They said it was important to have trained security staff inside and outside the bar, especially on busy nights. They felt this would help people feel more comfortable and avoid problems. Crowd size was also mentioned often. Some said the space should not be too packed because that would make it hard to enjoy the music or even move around. They suggested adding more open areas or private zones where people could relax.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Almost everyone agreed that the bar needs a strong opening plan. Some suggested having a big launch night with free entry or drink deals to get people interested. Others also said the bar should stay open later until 3 AM or even 6 AM, because people who love nightlife don’t want to leave early. Most interviewees said social media would be the best way to promote the bar. Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and even radio was mentioned. Some also said that old-school flyers at concerts or busy areas could help and others suggested working with rock influencers to spread the word and get fans excited.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Helpful advice was also given about growing the business. Many said it’s important to be patient in the beginning and let word-of-mouth build naturally. Someone also suggested having a feedback system, like giving guests a free drink if they leave a review or fill out a survey. This way, the bar can keep improving based on real customer opinions.</p>
			
			<p class="text-white questrial-regular">Most interviewees agreed that being open to change is key. The bar should stick to its rock theme but also listen to guests and update things if needed.</p>
			
		  <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>Key findings and potential improvements for the future:</strong></p>

			</ul>
	
          <p class="text-white questrial-regular"><strong>In conclusion:</strong> All interviewees were very excited about the final concept of the Booze 'N' Bands bar that we presented to them during the solution interviews. When tweaking the concept a bit based on the improvements and or suggestions mentioned above, the concept can be seen as high chance of becoming successful. As the improvements mentioned by our interviewees do not affect the business plan and lean canvas, making a new one was not necessary. The Booze 'N' Bands bar is a concept showing real potential to become a successful hard rock bar concept.</p>
